capacity begin the day with low pleasures using physical reminders chapter 7 applying what we learned the procrastinator the gym goer the smoker the video gamer the sleeper conclusion introduction i wrote this short book back in 2013 after beating my head painfully persistently against the thick wall of my motivational problems and finally breaking out into full understanding acceptance and self control i dealt with these issues the same way i deal and recommend dealing with all psychological troubles through introspection that is by paying attention to the subtle workings of one s own mind identifying the roots of the problem and devising the corresponding solution i wrote this book as a type of self help manual targeting the most common motivational problems in the world today against which most people end up wrecking themselves but that can be easily and effectively solved by a correct understanding of their own minds other than quitting cigarettes i intimately experienced all the motivational problems described in this book the five examples in chapter one are of composite persons based on my own personal introspections and on my extensive observations of the people around me who i saw struggling with the same issues as for the smoking example i was never addicted to cigarettes and therefore never needed to quit but from my countless observations of smokers around me attempting usually failing and once again trying to quit i noticed their quandary had the same essential determinants as every other motivational problem and could therefore be solved using the same methods since writing this book i ve applied every technique i advocate in it to my own life and with amazing success i only hope the hard won insights i lay out on its pages will prove as useful to you as they have been for me chapter 1 anomalies in human behavior over the course of our lives we have all no doubt had a chance to observe certain anomalies in our own behavior and i do not mean this in the sense of the overstated fact so often gaudily proclaimed by psychology students and enthusiasts that human beings behave irrationally what they refer to hardly manages to scratch the surface of the archaic psychic mechanisms that are at play in the human mind it isn t simply that people behave or even think irrationally but that the conscious control we exert over our behavior has sometimes partial sometimes little and sometimes no bearing on our manifest actions for anyone who has paid this any due attention it is indeed hard not to get the impression that some antagonistic forces within us are constantly pushing pulling and determining our actions no matter what our conscious intentions are and in spite of any deliberate opposition we may put up nearly all self observant persons will concede that they are not in full control of their behavior and there are many who feel that they truly have no control at all in large part they are correct procrastination it has been six weeks since jim was assigned an eight page paper for his american literature class he had thought about it frequently over the elapsed time he concluded that it would take no more than ten total hours to complete it he had multiple times made a resolution to begin the paper planning to get it out of the way early he shunned those resolutions over and over again and hasn t as much as written a word of it only now in the dead of night exactly ten hours before it is due jim begins feverishly writing and cobbling words together every minute of the next ten hours jim spends intensely working taking no breaks to rest watch television or play videogames as he is usually prone to doing he feels stressed irritated exhausted but in the course of those ten hours he manages to complete the paper and hands it in right on time now jim feels elated he feels a huge relief a grand weight lifted off his shoulders he is ecstatic he no longer feels tired despite staying up the extra ten hours to write the paper he thinks he can tackle anything overcome any hurdle never again he thinks from now on i will never leave an assignment to the last minute and have to spend such an excruciating time rushing to complete it but of course jim is doomed to find himself repeating this process over and over again procrastinating for days and weeks and months before beginning his assignments and always waiting until the very last minute before his assignment is due and when stalling any longer would cause him to flunk it 1 without a doubt this is an extremely common scenario one which many of us have experienced at one time or another if not perpetually so so why does it happen why do we waste countless hours on unproductive frivolous activities when we know there s work to be done why can t so many of us resist the urge to procrastinate what separates those of us who do from those who diligently complete all their work early or in a timely fashion why can t we force ourselves to work even though we know it isn t worth the stress and anxiety that we will experience in rushing to do it at the last second and of course the work itself then suffers on top of that many will conclude that they just have no willpower and yet in those final moments right before the assignment is due the willpower we call up to do it is nothing short of incredible at those times we may feel that if only we could harness that motivation we would be capable of anything but no one would wish onto themselves the constant feverish pressure of continuously having to complete a task under this type of hard deadline and those whose job puts them in these kinds of conditions most often greatly resent it there can of course be many negative physical and psychological side effects as well it is however possible to have the best of both worlds to be productive and proactive without the stress and strain that comes with having to meet a deadline and it has little to do with willpower as we will soon see willpower is only a skittish and insignificant factor what it requires is an understanding of motivation but let s leave this issue hanging for now and take in a few more examples loss of motivation annemarie is trying to lose weight she buys a membership to a local gym and for the first two weeks she goes there eagerly every day and gets an admirable workout on the first day of the third week she feels a reluctance to go but she still manages to pick herself up and visits the gym anyway the day after that she decides that it would be ok to skip a day and doesn t go and from that point forward just as with so many people she begins having an extremely hard time bringing herself to visit the gym most days she is unable to overcome this dreadful feeling and ends up failing to go at all soon she finds herself only going to the gym once a week then once every two weeks and eventually she stops going altogether this is of course a typical case of loss of motivation and an incredibly common one today cigarette addiction john is 36 years old he works at an accounting firm and is trying to quit cigarettes a habit he s been maintaining for the past 18 years he smokes half a pack a day but decides to quit cold turkey at many instances throughout his day he has a strong urge for a cigarette but then he remembers his vow to quit and resists it the first day he succeeds in resisting his urges and doesn t smoke even a single cigarette the next day however upon walking home from work he is surprised to find that a lit cigarette has found its way into his mouth and that he is happily puffing away at it he had taken a pack out of his pocket extracted a cigarette from it put it into his mouth pulled a lighter from his pocket lit the cigarette replaced both the pack and the lighter into his pocket once more and only after taking several large puffs from it does he realize that he s just done all this and actively defied his vow to quit smoking he takes one last deep drag from the cigarette and throws it out the next day to prevent a reoccurrence of this he takes the pack out of his pocket and stores it in his desk drawer at work he frequently yearns to have a smoke but then he imagines having to reach into the drawer to get it and stops himself soon enough however he finds himself outside with the pack in his hand and a lit cigarette in his mouth he retrieved it from the drawer went outside and deliberately lit the cigarette he was conscious of his actions but only after taking a few puffs of the cigarette does he realize his guilt grasping the full consequence of failing to uphold his vow against smoking he throws the cigarette out violently on the next day he throws out his pack altogether in order to not even have the opportunity to reach for it once again his urges to smoke are powerful but he has no ready opportunity to indulge them so he abstains over the course of the day however he discovers that he has made very little progress in his work and that his thoughts were being constantly drawn from his job to the act of going to the grocery store to buy a pack of cigarettes he finally decides that this painful attempt to quit is having unacceptable consequences for his professional life he goes to the store to buy a new pack deciding to put off his attempt to quit smoking for a later time perhaps when he takes a vacation john goes back to his regular routine of smoking half a pack a day in this example john actually put up quite a valiant effort to quit his addiction a much better effort than most people put up when they try to quit smoking but alas he was missing one crucial component in his strategy to quit cigarettes we ll see by the end of this book whether we can give john some advice on how next time to quit successfully videogame addiction junseo is home from college on winter break he has a moderate amount of homework and a few personal things he wants to accomplish while he is at home but nothing urgent on his first day home he wakes up at eight in the morning the rest of his family is asleep and he has no desire to go anywhere he is bored to quell his boredom junseo decides to indulge in a frequent childhood pastime of his and play a videogame he hasn t played any videogames whatsoever in a long time and he never had the slightest inclination to do so in college the playstation 2 he owned since childhood is still in his room and he slides in an old game he had completely forgotten about he starts the game anew having a slight feeling of nostalgia and for the next couple of hours he spends an enjoyable time reacquainting himself with its workings at ten o clock he has breakfast finding himself full and rather lethargic he ascertains that there still isn t anything substantial for him to do and he returns again to the videogame for several more hours he plays the game and is still somewhat entertained by it he looks at the clock and sees that it s 1 30 pm it s about time to quit this and go about my day he thinks i should go for a jog get my homework out of the way early maybe see some old friends he gets ready to leave the house but then decides to play for 15 more minutes before doing so those fifteen minutes pass but he still feels unsatisfied and decides to give himself another 10 minutes he does this perpetually sometimes losing track of time and granting himself a ten minute extension whenever he realizes he has played long past his self imposed quota only at 5 pm when he becomes very hungry is he able to quit the game and finally leave his house he decides to go for a jog and eat a hamburger at a local restaurant he does so but when he gets home he cannot bring himself to do any homework and defaults once again to the videogame he plays the game uninterrupted well into the night and only abandons it at 2 am when he is utterly exhausted he falls asleep the next day he wakes up at 10 30 am breakfasts and feels a strong urge to once again indulge in the videogame he made plans that day to meet with a couple friends around 7 pm at a bar he decides it d be ok to play the game for a bit since there is still so much time until the arranged meeting callous to the passage of time he plays the videogame for eight straight hours at exactly seven o clock he remembers that he must meet his friends rushes to get dressed and runs off to the bar at times while he is hanging out with his friends he recalls the videogame and feels a moderate yearning to play it as he is returning home from the hangout he looks forward to playing the game once more he follows through with that intention immediately taking up the game upon getting home and again proceeds to play it well into the night over the next several days the situation remains the same junseo cannot resist playing the game and is only torn from it when he must meet a few necessary obligations at his leisure he does nothing else and ends up playing the game an average of 12 hours each day during this time he constantly makes resolutions to stop but then concludes to do so after 15 more minutes after 20 more minutes after another hour he then defaults on his resolutions or loses track of time and ends up playing the game for multiple hours on end when he does succeed in breaking free from it and leaves his room in order to eat or run some errand as soon as he returns he invariably resumes playing the game and continues to do so for hours and hours more this continues for six days then at the end of the sixth day junseo finally succeeds in beating the game and as soon as he does he loses all interest in it and calmly stores his playstation away with no remorse whatsoever from that point forward he does not return to playing it or any other game and spends the rest of his winter break as he d intended doing his homework hanging out with friends and indulging his more mature and productive interests certainly anybody who plays or has played videogames or knows someone who does will recognize that this isn t at all an uncommon occurrence of course it is just the other side of the procrastination coin but this kind of behavior has some very intriguing peculiarities of its own videogames themselves are particularly interesting from a psychological standpoint and we will later see the special kind of motivational conditions they create oversleeping tom sleeps too much 11 hours a day on average tom is unhappy with this state of affairs but each day he is inadvertently coaxed by his circumstances to tack on those extra hours of sleep he is in perfect health physically and psychologically and yet he has a hard time getting out of bed in the morning even when he wakes up fully rested he often remains in bed and falls asleep for another hour or two or three he has few obligations except for his job where he is free to set his own schedule to conform to his day he works from home on a computer in his relatively small one room apartment the same room in which he sleeps after meals he often defaults to lying down on his bed and this often turns into a brief nap after finishing a part of his work he also generally takes to his bed and once again inadvertently dozes off he leaves his house to see friends or go for a walk or exercise at the gym almost every day but aside from that he mostly remains in his small apartment other than lying in bed and sleeping the rest of his day he spends working at his computer pacing around his cramped room and occasionally reading a book or watching tv which he also does while lying in bed despite his exorbitant amount of daily sleep tom has plenty of time to meet all of his obligations with hours left to spare for his waking leisure so what of this example colloquially this could be chalked up simply to laziness otherwise depression or perhaps some physical illness may be suspect and those can without a doubt be valid causes very often however even for such a straightforward behavior as sleep the primary determining factor is motivation and this is something that s usually completely overlooked i think these examples are sufficient in setting the scene and illuminating the problem that lies before us we want to know what are the elusive psychological mechanisms that underlie these behaviors so contradictory to our will we want to know why we can t bring ourselves to do certain things and can t stop ourselves from doing others why is this kind of behavior so prevalent in human beings and why is our willpower scarcely able to put up a contest against it why does doing certain tasks feel like lifting a giant boulder while other activities are so alluring that we are unable to tear ourselves from them and finally we want to know why and how we are able to sometimes overcome this what things we can learn from the times that we do and how we can implement that knowledge to gain a greater control over our fates chapter 2 unraveling the mystery without prematurely delving into any general psychological functions or theories thereof we will be good to first sketch a few rough strokes toward a comprehensive picture which unites the examples in front of us and here we can call upon a great insight a notion that is well recognized today in the difference between an act and its result the act and the result it may seem at first glance that jim wants to complete his paper annemarie wants to become fit john wants to stop smoking junseo wants to quit his videogame and tom wants to sleep less their behaviors are thus incomprehensible to us if we look closer however we will notice that what these people want are not those actions themselves but merely their results jim doesn t actually want to write his paper he wants the end result of writing his paper namely to pass his literature class annemarie doesn t want to actually go to the gym at least not after the first two weeks she also just wants its result specifically slimming down to her desired weight john most certainly does not want to not smoke smoking brings him great satisfaction he loves the taste of a cigarette and the calming sensation of the smoke he only wants the final result the health benefits saving money and being more pleasant to his friends and family so does junseo not want to quit the videogame he is enjoying the hell out of it he only wants the benefits of quitting having free time to do other more productive things and finally tom he too only wants the practical benefits of not sleeping the extra three hours each day and having that time to do better things but in the moment the pull of slumber is too sweet for him to resist with just that distinction then it appears that the whole portrait has come together and our initial puzzlement is entirely resolved but not so fast what we ve reached is not the solution to the psychological mechanics underlying human action but only the trailhead in our path to their understanding after all simply discriminating between an action and its consequences in no way tells us which factors determine whether a person will commit a particular action or not or when he will commit it or the ways he could be influenced to commit an action he otherwise wouldn t have and vice versa for instance jim did write his paper at least for two weeks annemarie did diligently attend the gym junseo did quit playing his videogame and john held out for a respectable while against his urges to smoke nevertheless we have started on the right path so let s follow it when the result outweighs the act if we look at jim s behavior while separating the activity of writing his paper from its consequences we can conclude that the reason he is able to finally write the paper is that the consequences of not doing so have become too dire once procrastinating any longer would have no other consequence than causing jim to fail his class rather than just causing him to write the paper later the magnitude of the consequences begins to outweigh jim s general distaste for writing and causes him to overcome it we can therefore conclude that a person s desire for a behavior itself for jim the actual process of writing his paper and his desire for its result in this case passing the class both contribute a motivating role toward whether or not he performs that behavior each exerts its own pull and if the two oppose one another the one that is stronger generally determines the person s manifest behavior but what actually goes on in a person s mind that leads to him choosing one such action over its opposite 2 anticipation of the act and the result there are two different scenarios in the psychological battle between action and result that we need to distinguish the first occurs when the person has not yet begun the action in question for example before jim begins his paper in that case both the action and its result are merely prospective they both exist in the mind as ideas as anticipations of the future the second scenario occurs when the person is already in the middle of the action when he is currently engaged in it for example while junseo is playing his videogame in that case there is a discrepancy between act and result since the person experiences the act as something physical present and ongoing while the result remains only a prospect an expectation of the future in jim s case both the act of writing the paper and its result exist only in his mind as prospects neither are physically occurring to him at the present moment and we know for a fact that the psychological factor that at last instigates jim to write his paper is anxiety thus we can conclude that the emotion of anxiety acts as the future s ambassador to the present for the consequences of jim s actions specifically anxiety about what would happen if jim fails to turn in his assignment we can assume that a similar representative exists for the prospect of the act itself and this we also know to be in jim s case the overall affect of dread that accompanies the idea of writing his paper whenever jim contemplates doing so 3 in light of this evidence we can appreciate the large role that affect and emotion plays in motivating a person toward action in any case it is by no means a farfetched claim that future and or prospective events bear on a person s present mind via the thoughts associations and affects they call up when thought about present activities versus future consequences now in situations such as junseo s where future prospects conflict with a presently engaged in activity the videogame we are able to gauge fairly well the kind of influences these two factors exert on a person s actions for junseo who is so strongly bound by the activity of playing the game it is clear that his future prospects have hardly any effect in compelling him to quit it since no considerations of the consequences of playing the game for so long or about other more productive things he could be doing are able to draw him away from the game for even an instant despite such thoughts popping up quite often we can conclude that compared to his present experience of playing the game and the enjoyment he receives from it those future prospects are not very potent some future events do make him quit his game however such as his plans to meet up with his friends and these act upon him in the same way a deadline acts on the procrastinator by prompting him to carry out his intentions at the very last minute we also know that in this case that behavior is caused by precisely the same factor anxiety namely his anxiety about the consequences of bailing out on his friends another thing that makes him quit the videogame is a strong hunger what we see here is that this situation is almost identical to the one in which the action is only a future prospect and that should not astound us so greatly when we realize that junseo s case is merely the negative of the previous one in jim s case jim was trying to begin an activity writing the paper in junseo s case junseo is trying to quit one playing the videogame but all it takes is rephrasing the state of affairs to see that the two are actually the same we may say that jim is trying to quit the activity of procrastinating whatever actual activity that entails and it may very well be a videogame and we may say that junseo is trying to begin a different activity whatever he wishes to do instead of the game such as meeting up with his friends each such scenario really has two parts quitting one activity and starting another it will be useful to keep this in mind nevertheless we can clearly distinguish a pattern here it is the concrete future events with concrete consequences that most effectively motivate a person to act in opposition to his present desires that for so many people the motivating effect of an obligation takes place only at the last make or break moment is due to the fact that that is when its impending consequences are truly felt whereas at any earlier time the perceived consequences are only of having to deal with the issue later that is not however because the emotion of anxiety begins to be felt at precisely that time there is always an aspect of anxiety to this kind of impending obligation although it is granted that at those last moments the anxiety is generally strongest we must also not ignore that a strong feeling of hunger quite similar in its psychological nature to a strong feeling of anxiety causes junseo to quit the game just like his promise to join his friends the activation energy for starting an activity we ve now accepted that much involuntary behavior such as the kind exhibited in our examples is the result of a person having opposing desires for an action and its consequences where either 1 the attraction of a particular activity overpowers the motivating power of its negative consequences or 2 the motivating power of beneficial consequences is not enough to overpower the person s aversion to the activity that causes them this however does not account for a lot of very similar behavior where these conditions aren t present and it does not account fully for a lot of the behavior in which these conditions are present that is because there remains one other factor we have not yet considered let us take as an example an extremely simple case in which a person has a definite and non ambivalent positive desire for an action and for its consequences chris wants to go play basketball at the court at his gym he enjoys playing basketball and it gives him a great workout in return he has nothing better to do but chris lives 30 minutes away from the courts and every time he considers going he thinks about the long walk it will take to get there and then cannot bring himself to get off the couch he ends up not going and watches tv instead in this scenario chris wants both the activity and its consequences what he doesn t want is to take the actions needed to commence the activity we may think that this is the hallmark of laziness but what would we think if the walk was instead two hours or four in any case every activity has this type of entrance barrier a kind of activation energy and very often it is precisely this entrance barrier that prevents a person from taking the actions he needs to begin an activity even if that activity is both desirable in itself and beneficial in the long run in light of this it seems that it would be best to consider the execution of an activity as consisting of two separate parts the actions required to begin the activity and the activity itself thus in the mental contest between a prospective activity and its consequences we must also factor in the actions that must be taken to begin that activity nearly always those preparatory actions will act as a deterrent from engaging in the activity itself since they are so often of a tedious effortful nature if an activity is unsavory but its consequences desirable this entrance barrier of beginning the activity serves as an additional opposing factor if an activity is alluring but the consequences detrimental the effort necessary to begin the activity can be the deciding deterrent that tips the balance toward abstaining and if both the activity and the consequences are desirable the preparatory action can still be enough of a demotivator to result in inaction in conclusion after the resolution of the mental struggle between an activity and its consequences the victor must do battle in yet another similar struggle between it and the act of beginning that first activity it is this second round of decision making that people so often butt up against only to default to inaction right when they ve gathered enough initiative to undertake an unpleasant activity and in the case of a person trying to quit in the middle of an activity he is already engaged in the steps needed to do so serve the exact same role the picture so far so far we have made decent progress in roping in the issue of human motivation most importantly we identified three psychologically separate parts to every activity the activity itself its consequences and the effort needed to start it which may conflict with one another in a person s mind and pull him by a psychological process we don t yet know in opposite directions i ve represented this finding in figure 1 on the following page it seems however that we are now approaching somewhat of a dead end and will soon be at a loss about how to proceed on our trail of inquiry after all analyzing behavior according to such general terms as mental struggles desirability and deterrents can only get us so far to gain any profound understanding of our current problem we must examine more microscopically the actual mental processes that occur in a person s mind when he is contemplating a future action and its consequences only then will we be able to determine the most significant factors by which he decides his course of action and learn how to gain control over his actions by purposely manipulating those factors indeed it is very often the case in the scientific process that an intricate problem must be approached from multiple different angles before it yields a solution we will approach this problem now from the direction of introspective psychology from which we can gain the most profound understanding of human motivation and with it the power to cure addiction to increase productivity to circumvent laziness and so much more and so let us set off on this adjacent path that leads directly to a solution of motivation and in the process we will also attain the solution to our current inquiries at the point where these two paths intersect chapter 3 the psychological nature of motivation we will begin by establishing the motivating or demotivating role of physical sensation for the purpose of a rudimentary example let us take two people with knee pain with person a experiencing more physical pain when walking than person b all other factors being equal we can confidently predict that person b will be able to walk farther than person a before they both succumb to the pain and sit to rest we can make the exact same prediction if we are dealing with only one person person c at two different points in time where at one time he feels more pain than at another and all other factors remain equal we can then say without a shadow of a doubt that he will stop sooner at the time when he experiences more pain and the state of affairs cannot possibly be any other way it is precisely in this manner that pain affects us it motivates us to stop doing whatever causes the pain and the greater the pain the greater the motivation to stop doing it the true motivation a person has in this scenario and those like it is the simple one to get rid of pain or at least to reduce it and this doesn t only apply to physical pain it is true of literally everything that has a pain like unpleasant quality to it the greater the physical sensation of hunger in a person the more he will be motivated to eat to relieve it the colder a person feels the more motivated he will be to find warmth the greater the magnitude of an itch the more compelled a person will be to scratch it it is also evident to us that when such a pain is being experienced it not only provides the motivation for the particular action that soothes it but also takes motivation away from all other actions that do not and this corresponds very strongly with its magnitude speaking of motivation in colloquial terms a person who is extremely sick with a stomach virus vomiting fever etc will temporarily abandon all his aspirations and lose interest in all activities except those that provide some relief to his malaise if he were to get a call from the president he would likely tell him to call back tomorrow now let us see if we can extend this principle to emotions nobody can deny the motivating power of emotions even in the most colloquial usages of the term the role of emotions is implicitly acknowledged in this regard consider what answer an actor most often looks for when asking before a scene what is my motivation we have also seen from the examples at the start of this book how the emotion of anxiety motivates the procrastinator to finally write his paper and the video gamer to finally tear himself from his game but there is no doubt that emotions such as sadness and anxiety and anger whatever else they may do evoke by their nature a physical displeasure in addition the actions any of these emotions motivate a person to undertake have the result of soothing or dissipating that unpleasant emotion and sometimes also replacing it with a pleasant one a person experiencing anger will seek to avenge himself on the person or thing he is angry at when he does the anger disappears a person who is anxious will seek usually to avoid whatever evokes in him the feeling of anxiety as soon as he does his anxiety goes away the function of sadness is more complicated but it too generally makes a person withdraw from the saddening situation and in this way at least soothes the emotion in light of this we are obliged to conclude that the motivating role of these emotions is played in large part if not entirely by the physical feelings of displeasure that come alongside them and by the most fundamental tenets of cause and effect we can say with absolute certainty that if the only effect those emotions had was eliciting the displeasure that is so characteristic of them along with an inherent way of relieving it such as revenge they would produce precisely the same motivating effects on a person at least in quality as they already do really what is the fundamental difference in the situation of an angry person who wants revenge or an anxious person who seeks safety from the hungry person who wants food the tired person who wants rest the nauseous person who wants to vomit or the horny person who wants sex so too are there tons of examples in everyday life where these emotions compete with physical displeasure of a different sort as equal opponents on a level playing field to determine a person s actions consider that a shy child who is too anxious to ask his teacher if he can use the bathroom finally overcomes this anxiety when his need to urinate becomes too great an adolescent who refuses to eat out of anger in order to spite his mother will find that his anger eventually succumbs to a more powerful feeling of hunger and in nearly all cases the deeply conscientious or religious person will come upon times when his natural sexual urges which by the way definitely entail a feeling of displeasure and tension will grow more intense than any feelings of shame he or she feels on the subject and cause him to seek relief by way of intercourse or masturbation 4 from this exposition we cannot help but get the impression that we ve just unearthed a psychological mechanism of the most central importance for human functioning it is the existence of a deep psychological need or more accurately compulsion to reduce displeasure pain when it arises that motivates compels humans to undertake the behavior required for carrying out all of their vital biological functions what is even more striking is that this very same mechanism of compulsion is also responsible for a wide variety of much more complicated and much less essential even superficial behaviors but before we address the generality of these findings we must realize that we only have half of the picture in addition to the need to reduce pain we find that humans have an equivalent need to increase pleasure the motivation of seeking pleasure if we take a person in what we will call a neutral state when he experiences no pleasure or displeasure we will find the most clear cut common characteristic in the endless variety of things he will seek they will all be of a pleasurable nature the person in this state can essentially be described as bored 5 in such a state the person s mind will be drawn to and stay fixated on things that bring pleasure and this does not only pertain to actions that bring pleasure if pleasurable activities are out of his reach the person will be compelled to seek that pleasure from thought he will indulge in imaginative fantasies recall pleasant memories or contemplate something of interest and if for some reason he is unable to do even that and to attain his pleasure consciously his unconscious mind will step in by way of associations and hallucinations supplying that pleasure it will strike up a song in his head call up an encouraging chant or personal mantra or place him inside a pleasant hallucination as is so common in unconscious daydreams so for whomever has wondered why during times of idleness some song or tune would forcibly intrude into his mind or why every so often he would inexplicably find himself mentally uttering a particular phrase or chant always by the way of a self extolling nature or of a testament to having overpowered some hardship or why he is so often compelled to indulge in imaginative fantasy or why his thoughts are so fervently and constantly drawn to a given activity such as playing a videogame or watching television or pornography on the basis of which we may conclude an addiction to that activity the reason is that all those thoughts ideas and miscellaneous content that pop into one s head are of an entertaining pleasurable nature it is your mind subconsciously trying to entertain you or lead you to pleasure but the mind does not simply want to obtain pleasure it wants to increase pleasure a person waking up in a neutral state will be quite content to take up a mildly pleasurable activity such as reading a book one that isn t extraordinarily exciting perhaps a textbook or working on a creative assignment provided that it does bring the person some pleasure however he will find it very difficult to do that same activity right after doing something that is more pleasurable such as playing a game or watching a tv show since that would constitute an overall decrease in pleasure he will experience the same dread and resistance against doing so that he would against a purely unpleasurable action such as a chore that requires no urgency when he is in a neutral state we can also observe this effect in the up to now puzzling and rather disconcerting mental phenomenon that most of us have no doubt experienced while reading a book we notice that at some point in our reading we have in fact ceased to comprehend any of the content and have become completely engrossed in our own thoughts we also know that once this has occurred it becomes extremely difficult to resume reading for little to no time will pass until that same thing occurs and we are again in our own thoughts the reason for this is that the thoughts that usurp our mind bring more pleasure than does reading the book and once the book has sparked interest in a more enticing and pleasurable train of thought the activity of pursuing that thought is unconsciously adopted over the activity of reading otherwise this same effect can occur if the book activates ideas of a worrying or angering or saddening nature or if some other kind of displeasure comes upon us which our thoughts then become naturally preoccupied with relieving in every instance that our attention strays so involuntarily and automatically from reading it is invariably the result of one of these two factors it is given up in favor of something more pleasurable or because something displeasurable has been evoked and this also holds true of all scenarios of a similar nature of going off on a tangent in our own thinking of our mind wandering when listening to a speech or lecture and so forth the ubiquity of pleasure and displeasure as motivation all the evidence we ve just encountered testifies to the existence of a deep seated psychological influence exerted by the physical sensations of pleasure and displeasure on many types of human cognition and behavior we can describe the nature of this influence best as a fundamental human compulsion to increase pleasure and reduce displeasure to psychologists in the late 19th and early 20th century this was actually a widely recognized and accepted idea seeking pleasure and avoiding displeasure was then considered to be the most fundamental striving of the human mind upon which all other psychological functions were based freud commonly referred to it as the pleasure principle but this is no longer even a notion in modern psychology today 6 and yet we can conclude solely on the basis of our own evidence that a very large portion of human motivation is undeniably determined by precisely this factor the pleasure principle certainly this realization alone is a huge gain a reclamation really in our understanding of human psychology and behavior however when we pursue this issue further we come across an infinitely more astounding discovery we find that there is no aspect of human functioning in which this element is absent and that the pleasure principle in fact plays the lead role in directing the course of a person s behavior and thinking in every case if we become attuned to observing this effect in ourselves we will notice that even the most trivial actions such as getting out of bed in the morning are wholly determined by this kind of pleasure displeasure based motivation while lying in bed still provides pleasure which it certainly does very often a person will only be able to get up if some greater prospect of pleasure such as excitement about starting a new day or going for a morning run or curiosity about the results of a sports game or the desire to see a new episode of a beloved show or else an immediate displeasure such as an urge to urinate hunger the annoying sound of an alarm clock pain from lying in bed for too long anxiety about something that needs to be done perhaps a stab of revulsion at sleeping too much is experienced 7 and even if lying in bed no longer brings pleasure or even some displeasure when one is no longer sleepy and it becomes uncomfortable to remain in bed the person will often require more motivation still to compel him to get up since the actual act of getting out of bed is itself frequently displeasurable especially if it requires exposing one s body to the cold or takes a significant amount of effort such as climbing off the top bunk 8 what our findings tell us is that the need to increase pleasure and relieve displeasure is not merely a major type of motivation but the very essence of motivation itself it is the active psychological force behind all motivation much to the credit of 19th century psychologists and anything that can be regarded as motivation derives its effect from precisely this source and yet despite its ubiquitous presence and its dominant controlling role in all aspects of human cognition and behavior unless this effect is made explicit to them people are usually completely oblivious to the role pleasure and displeasure plays in motivating their lives to them it is entirely unconscious while those who do notice their feelings tend to regard them as the result or side effect of their thoughts and their actions when in truth they are the cause recognizing now the pervading and orchestrating influence of this element its most rudimentary binary functionality and its uncannily unconscious nature we can no longer have any doubts that what we are dealing with here is an entirely distinct unconscious mechanism in the human mind the most archaic and the most important within the domain of our psychological theory we must make a distinct place for it as a unique unconscious system in the human psyche 9 alongside the well recognized and copiously studied associative unconscious we can now add a second entirely separate system that we will hazard to call the pleasure unconscious the pleasure unconscious in animals but once we admit this separate system as a key component of human functioning we cannot ignore that most of the functions it controls as well as its means to control them are undeniably present in animals too in fact the solely human ability of conscious volition which is to a certain degree independent of the pleasure unconscious while being our main counteracting force against it is entirely absent in lower animals so if the pleasure principle only roughly directs and controls human behavior we can assume that it does so almost entirely for animal behavior and this principle holds just as valid for organisms that reach all the way down to the earliest branches of evolution all this of course makes great sense the pleasure unconscious recognizes only two inputs pleasure and displeasure and as its sole function propels the organism to seek the former and avoid the latter this most basic binary functionality speaks of its ancient evolutionary origins perhaps as early as some of the first origins of life we could see this type of binary functionality in bacteria indeed we still do today a simple bacterium only needs to sense whether something is a necessary nutrient good for it and use its cilia to swim toward it or whether it is toxic harmful and bad for it and use its cilia to move away from it if those weren t the actual evolutionary beginnings of the pleasure unconscious indeed it is hard to imagine that they were its origin was at least rooted in the same reason a rudimentary simple organism would only need to avoid bad things and seek out nutrients it is the necessary evolutionary start once this first binary system is developed the evolution of a more complicated organism would require more diversified functionality thus with this binary groundwork already laid down the natural course of evolution would be and indeed seems to have been to build upon it at some point down the evolutionary line we can see the development of instincts and emotions probably in that order which appear to be built upon the pleasure principle in helping the organism adapt to its environment 10 we can then see now for the much more complicated organism that it needs not only to seek or avoid good and harmful things respectively but that it also needs to perform a variety of other diverse tasks since introspection will tell us nothing about the instincts of animals let us first talk about emotions and the functions they serve it is clear that emotions are built upon the pleasure principle and that they motivate behavior in a particular way simply by the laws of the pleasure unconscious the behavior that those emotions motivate is also without a doubt evolutionarily advantageous take the emotion of anger an angry person will seek to get revenge or commit violence upon whatever instigated that anger anger is itself unpleasant and the ingrained biological way to get rid of that anger is by obtaining revenge which also brings about a cathartic satisfaction a great pleasure when achieved anger is resistance to being harmed retribution to the harmer while it does not soothe the current injury it is a response to it serves to protect oneself from future assaults by making it known to one s attacker that there will be consequences we can clearly observe this in animals or take the emotion of anxiety an anxious person will want to rid himself of the anxiety because it is displeasurable and he will seek to do so by escaping whatever evokes that anxiety if the anxiety is brought on by thoughts of a future action he will seek to avoid that action but if it is brought on by thoughts of inaction it will provoke him instead into action the evolutionary benefit of anxiety is among other things avoiding danger and this we can certainly see in animals as well the whole range of emotions the behaviors they motivate and the benefits they provide is too lengthy a topic to analyze here but i will assert that all emotions operate on precisely that principle as for instincts can we not surmise that an animal feels a great instigation a nagging displeasure to commit a particular act or movement when exposed to a stimulus that a bird cannot help pecking when it sees red because it causes it an unpleasant tension not to do so 11 that a baby duck feels displeasure anxiety when it is out of sight of its mother figure that a fish has the compulsion to guard its eggs lest it feel huge discomfort or angst and that it derives pleasure from doing so that any animal when given the chance will know exactly how to mate because the motor notion of the act evokes inner excitement or that an animal voices a mating call to attract a mate not as an unfeeling matter of course but simply because that call feels satisfying as a natural expression of its sexual yearning to follow the evolutionary steps of brain development further we can infer that after the evolution of instincts and emotions or perhaps at the same time evolved associative memory giving brains the ability to imprint and associate stimuli with the pleasure pain emotions and instincts they once evoked this development enabled creatures to adapt their behavior based on past experiences it allowed them to learn that associative memory and the feelings by association it produces are of course still very strong in humans today and it was only after all this in the history of evolution that the rational explicit thinking and imagination unique to human beings finally developed the dynamics of the pleasure unconscious having listed all this we can now appreciate the complex interactions of all that contributes to human behavior the sensations from the external world emotions instincts associative affect and explicit imagination are all diverse sources of pleasure and displeasure that in some way affect human action and cognition but in the end all these act directly upon the first tier of motivation and the highest court of appeal for all human physical and psychological assets the pleasure unconscious it is based on this evidence that we come to our conclusion that the major determining forces behind human thought and behavior are not cognitive but conative we can thus gain a much more fundamental understanding of the influences behind human as well as animal behavior if we think of every physical sensation and mental element a thought an idea a memory a belief in terms of whether it is pleasurable or displeasurable and every action and activity in terms of the way it increases pleasure or relieves displeasure 12 if we refer back to the procrastination example we can see this principle in action most clearly it may have puzzled us before that the emotion of anxiety whose effect is notorious for producing avoidance causes the procrastinator in the final span of time before his assignment is due to burst into a flurry of the most purposeful action not to mention that until those final moments the impending assignment already caused him a fair amount of anxiety yet failed to produce an effect the solution comes to us when we view his anxiety as nothing other than a displeasurable sensation the person experiences when he contemplates the things that will happen if he doesn t complete his assignment as long as there still remains time to dawdle the unpleasant anxiety provoking thought of failing the assignment can be easily dismissed along with its anxiety by simply resolving to do the work later and then brushing that thought from one s mind and truly the thought and anxiety both go away right then and there once there s no longer time to waste however this maneuver ceases to work and the only action that can relieve his anxiety which is now at its strongest becomes to physically do the assignment 13 another extremely interesting fact to observe is how intimately and inseparably a person s emotional responses to future events are tied to his actual expectations of them in reality the procrastinator for instance no matter how hard he tries and in the absence of mind altering substances will never be able to trick or convince himself that he has already done his assignment or that no real assignment existed in the first place in the same way a person who tries to impose a deadline on himself knowing that there will be no manifest consequences is utterly powerless to convince himself that there will be or to conjure up any of the anxiety he so automatically feels when facing a real deadline with real consequences indeed many of us meet with this problem in attempting to carry out our volitional undertakings when we possess no external deadlines and have to answer only to ourselves attention and the pleasure unconscious there is one more issue i wish to discuss before ending this exposition it has to do with multitasking the fact that people have the ability to successfully engage in multiple activities at a time as long as they are able to devote the necessary amount of attention to each one this is actually a psychological factor of crucial importance but i will only briefly delve into it here we know as fact that our capacity for attention is limited finite the actual amount we have at our disposal fluctuates over the course of each day and some activities require a greater amount of attention than others 14 our attention can be put to use for two functions perception and action the fact is that there is only a limited amount of information our senses can take in at once we are able to perceive only a finite amount of the stimuli we are exposed to in addition it is not just stimuli from the external world that we can perceive but our conscious thoughts and imagination as well as our unconscious thoughts associations and hallucinations all of these we experience through that same system of perception 15 and all of these vie for the same finite amount of attention required to process them we cannot listen to two speeches at once and understand both if we read a book we cannot also hold a conversation or think an independent thought if we watch tv while playing chess our analytical thinking in the game will suffer in the same way we cannot solve a very difficult math problem if we are also listening to music we cannot think much when we are fully engrossed by taking in the external world and vice versa during dreams there is little to no possibility for conscious thought and so is the hallucinating schizophrenic unable to really see the world or maintain control over his conscious thinking but voluntary action also vies for that same amount of attention just as feeling sensation in a body part requires attention so too does moving that body part in fact the two are inseparable whenever we lose sensation in a part of our body by whatever means we always find that we ve lost the ability to move it as well 16 certainly most of us who play a physical sport will have had an opportunity to observe that we will play worse and react slower whenever we are engaged in miscellaneous thought when our attention is elsewhere and when we take particular interest in observing something while walking we often trip up we may regard observing the world and hallucinating to be passive perception conscious thinking however has a very definite volitional and deliberate element to it and indeed we do find that conscious thought and reasoning truly requires a huge amount of attention even though the perceptual content it imposes on our senses through the audible words and visible images it manipulates is of no great magnitude the reason i needed to mention this topic of attention is that it is precisely attention that the pleasure unconscious exerts its control over in its aim to increase pleasure and decrease displeasure it compulsively usurps our attention in service of thoughts actions associations and hallucinations that work to bring us pleasure or relieve displeasure lastly we have to recognize that there always exists in us the strongest need to utilize all our attention and this is quite evident in the great amount of displeasure we feel any time the entirety of our capacity for attention is not being put to use when this is the case we will seek to find outlets for our unused attention if we are playing a chess game with a weaker opponent we will seek to supplement this activity with another such as watching tv or listening to music or playing another simultaneous chess game very often this manifests itself in unconscious movements such as fiddling around with something in one s hands or pacing around the room and if such an action also serves to increase pleasure or relieve displeasure all the better 17 attention and willpower there is an interesting interaction here too in that feelings of pleasure and displeasure simultaneously direct attention and since they are physical sensations require attention to be perceived and like with all stimuli the more attention a person devotes to one the more vividly he then perceives it this of course is in full accordance with the functions of the pleasure unconscious since the first thing a stimulus whether painful or pleasurable requires to affect a person s cognition is to be perceived by him it is thus only natural that the more intense a sensation the more attention the person will automatically grant to it the curious nuance here lies in the undeniable fact that humans are able to exert some conscious control over where they direct their attention we can recognize this ability and the aptitude a person has for utilizing it to be what people normally call willpower this willpower is in fierce competition with and is often overpowered by the pleasure unconscious a person will indeed find it very difficult to devote his attention to thoughts or external happenings that bring him no pleasure and reduce no displeasure and the times that he does he will usually find that he s unable to maintain that attention for long 18 but a person s conscious ability to choose what he pays attention to while mostly trumped by the pleasure unconscious when it comes to thoughts and external events can also be used in another indirect way to rein in his pleasure unconscious the person can consciously focus his attention on the things he is feeling and thus moderate at least to some extent the magnitude of their pleasure and displeasure 19 this in turn allows a person who is experiencing multiple displeasurable affects to consciously select which displeasures he will deal with first instead of being irresistibly drawn to the most intense ones since he can in effect control their intensity having taken this into account let s now move on to the next chapter in which we will further explore the nuances of willpower attention and the pleasure unconscious chapter 4 how the pleasure unconscious operates we began this book with five examples of peculiar human behavior that occurred contrary to the better judgment and willpower of the persons committing it those and similar behaviors fall roughly into the categories of addiction procrastination and laziness in each case the person was either very hard pressed or unable to carry out the action he or she wanted or had that same difficulty quitting an action he or she didn t want we then proceeded to evaluate the different opposing factors in a person s situation that would lead him to commit this behavior despite his better intentions we found that it had to do with a psychological conflict between the actual behavior the result of that behavior and the actions necessary to begin or quit it we ascertained that this kind of conflict could sometimes be influenced by the emotion of anxiety but aside from that we were mostly at a loss as to what actual psychological forces were actively butting up against each other and opposing one another as the arbiters of this conflict we now know exactly what those psychological forces are at their most fundamental level they are pleasure and displeasure with this newly acquired insight we become able to both understand and correct the detrimental behaviors at the start of this book and countless others like them the key to this lies not in appealing to a person s logic or in cultivating his willpower but in appealing to the deep seated functions of his pleasure unconscious 20 but before we tackle these issues head on we will be good to take a more precise survey of how the pleasure unconscious operates and take stock of the full arsenal of psychological weapons we have to redirect control and exploit it displeasure motivation versus pleasure motivation there is a fundamental difference between the actions motivated by reducing displeasure and those motivated by increasing pleasure for one displeasure motivates a very specific course of action the one needed to get rid of or to at least partly soothe that displeasure pleasure on the other hand can be attained from a variety of different sources a person will usually have only a few if not just one particular thing that he can do to rid himself of his displeasure hunger can be best quelled by eating coldness by warming up tiredness by sleeping stiffness by stretching an itch by scratching having to urinate by peeing physical pain by removing whatever causes it and so forth and this holds true of emotions as well the sad person will want happiness an angry person will want revenge the anxious person will want to escape the anxiety provoking situation and so forth assuming the necessary course of action is evident to the person which it usually is his attention will be powerfully drawn to thoughts of executing that action and how he should go about it a hungry person will find himself thinking of food and how to get it a tired person will think of snagging some sleep a horny person will think about sex an angry person will think about revenge and so on 21 to increase pleasure is another matter this compulsion is satisfied at least to a quite large degree by any increase in pleasure whether it is a slight one from reading the news a moderate one from listening to music or a great one from having sex a person in a neutral state of pleasure bored will have an affinity for all such actions if they re even a little pleasurable what he actually ends up choosing greatly depends on other pleasure factors such as how much effort unpleasurable it takes to begin it and what consequences he can expect from it it is in this scenario where a person has a variety of possible actions before him all of which constitute some gain in pleasure that his willpower and rationale can have the greatest influence over his manifest actions the practical takeaway from this is that we should become aware of whether the behavior we are trying to control is motivated by relieving displeasure or acquiring pleasure behaviors like smoking or masturbating can at different times and in the same person be motivated by either of the two or both this is an important nuance to be mindful of because dealing with each requires a different method pleasure from different sources a very important question to address is how much control do we really have very often if not almost always most people feel that they have full control over their thoughts and actions that they are masters of themselves and of their own fate is this an illusion in large part yes the pleasure unconscious is extremely obscure and to notice it within oneself and make its existence explicit is horrendously difficult it is so well hidden from our consciousness that we take for granted all its effects on us its utter domination over our minds it prompts no explanation and is in the most direct sense implicit 22 and all the while this utterly unconscious system is always seeking to be satisfied it is always present not simply in short bursts as our emotions are but as a force that is in our lives always it is nonetheless true that humans are able to consciously exert some control over what we pay attention to but this is in fierce competition with the pleasure unconscious it will be very hard to focus on something that brings us no pleasure or reduces no displeasure and most of those times that we do feel in control we are simultaneously acquiescing to the strivings of the pleasure unconscious if we try to fully recall a painful memory or if we try reading a dull book that brings us no pleasure whatever at every opportunity some association to something more pleasurable will pop into our minds and if we try to dismiss it we will not persist for long until something else that is pleasurable forcefully gains our audience it is however not an uncommon occurrence that we are able to devote our attention or at least part of it to something that only brings displeasure or is neutral our attention after all need not be devoted to only one thing it can be split up divided amongst multiple thoughts activities and perceptions the pleasure unconscious if no displeasure is currently being experienced simply wants an increase in pleasure and this can be satisfied with only a portion of our attention the pleasure unconscious isn t actually hard to satiate although the human mind will certainly seek pleasure when there is none it is for the most part satisfied with just a small amount of it or rather a small increase in it and a person is often able to meet this quota while only investing a small portion of his attention to do so there is a great variety of ways to attain pleasure smelling a pleasant smell looking at beautiful scenery or art listening to music feeling pleasure in a cool breeze or a hot shower eating a tasty food taking drugs doing an intricate task playing a game exercising reading an interesting book experiencing a pleasant emotion entertaining an intriguing thought indulging in fantasy listening to comedy hanging out with friends and so on and so forth some of these naturally require more attention than others and some naturally provide more pleasure than others and of course there isn t a perfect overlap between the two it is when we are able to gain pleasure with only a part of our attention that we are free to invest what remains into a thought process or task of our own choice it is after all not unpleasurable to do chores while listening to music or when drunk to think about something neutral while biking or swimming or to write an essay while drinking a sweet cup of coffee and it is during the times when we waste little or no attention while experiencing pleasure that we become capable of the greatest feats pleasure is relative it is important to remember that the pleasure unconscious does not just seek pleasure but seeks to increase pleasure and this has very interesting effects on a person s manifest actions if a person is experiencing a small amount of pleasure for instance if he is listening to a song that he likes while working on an otherwise unpleasurable homework assignment he will not particularly seek to change his activity to something more pleasurable even though he could easily devote the mental assets he s currently using to do his assignment to play a videogame instead which he would certainly enjoy a lot more partially this is because most of his attention is already invested in the double activity of listening to the song while doing his homework and he has no attention to spare for thinking of more pleasurable activities another contributing factor is that the anticipation of a greater pleasure such as he d get from the videogame is often not strong enough to overpower the actual pleasure he s already experiencing and so does not much compel him to exchange that activity for another a bird in the hand is worth more than two in the bush but if that person s attention is diverted from the assignment for some reason he gets a phone call or the whole process becomes unpleasurable he grows tired of the music or the assignment or both he will be very compelled to switch to a more pleasurable activity and will very often succumb to that compulsion a completely opposite effect comes into play however if a person attempts to switch from a very pleasurable activity like a videogame to a less pleasurable one like listening to music while doing homework even if it s still objectively enjoyable this constitutes a decrease in pleasure and the modus operandi of the pleasure unconscious makes the person extremely averse to such a change he will have a very hard time relinquishing a large pleasure for a smaller one and that transition is usually only achieved if something else displeasurable intervenes between those two activities it is because of this that we can speak of higher and lower pleasures and it is why to the person whose life is filled with the greatest ecstatic achievements and victories the lower sources of enjoyment such as playing videogames or getting drunk or masturbating are inherently unattractive as avenues of enjoyment the pleasure in activities it should be well understood that when we regard an activity as pleasurable it is only a summary of the whole range of nuances that occur during that activity it is an average of the ups and downs the pleasurable and unpleasurable experiences that usually occur in rapid succession in most activities one factor that makes many activities pleasurable is that they consume a lot and sometimes all of a person s attention and this as we mentioned is a very significant striving of the human mind one that is also propelled by the pleasure unconscious playing a game chess for example or building a structure let s say a table or creating a painting or writing a paper or programming a website or making a soup and so on and so forth all share the same characteristics of being very involved and often thought provoking we of course know that directed thought requires a huge amount of attention in each such activity a person is constantly thinking of what the situation requires next breaking the larger problem into simpler smaller pieces thinking over how he should go about accomplishing each piece then physically executing the necessary actions and finally moving on to the next hurdle although that process is not always pleasurable each time he accomplishes a small step if it was in any way difficult he will naturally experience a tinge of the happiness emotion he will feel satisfaction a sense of accomplishment and this is without a doubt pleasurable 23 he will also feel a sense of anticipated relief and excitement from the prospect of reaching his goal and bringing that activity to a successful end this too is pleasurable and it motivates him to continue an interesting nuance of this involvement in an activity is that the enjoyment a person derives from it greatly depends upon his ability to engage in it and this depends in turn on the amount of attention he s able to devote to the activity it is for this reason that when a person s capacity for attention naturally decreases throughout the day when he becomes tired or eats too much or if his attention is sapped by something else he is distracted by something more pleasurable or some displeasure forces him to devote his attention to it the activity that had just before been pleasurable for him now becomes distinctly unpleasurable this is partially due to him no longer being able to successfully execute the necessary steps in his task because he does not have enough attention to work through it this deprives him of the ups the bursts of happiness he feels when he succeeds in it and partially it is due to his new inability to consciously assess what steps to take next or whether those steps are the correct ones this leads to uncertainty and a feeling of dread and even anxiety about how the result of the task will turn out as opposed to the anticipated relief and excitement he felt when confident of success 24 all the things that can be pleasurable about an activity are exhibited blatantly in games and even more so in videogames each part of a videogame is new filled with excitement and surprise if the game is any good that is and the player must constantly achieve small goals and overcome hurdles in moving toward the final goal of winning the game he is motivated by progressing in the game which endows him with a sense of excitement and an anticipation of future fun as well as a curiosity for what will happen next 25 and because many videogames do not require very much conscious involvement in order to progress through them they can continue to be enjoyable even if somewhat less so when the person is tired or when his attention is split or if it is in some other way diminished it is because of this perfect storm of pleasurable factors that videogames are so addictive interestingly very much of their pleasurable effects are taken away once the person completes the game and already knows what to expect from it pleasurable emotions positive emotions are a very distinct source of pleasure what makes them so unique and intriguing from a motivational standpoint is that they linger that is they can be a source of pleasure without taking up any attention at all there aren t many positive emotions as compared to negative ones there is happiness excitement and affection love following a greatly triumphant event the happiness emotion can remain as a lingering pleasure for hours or even days rendering a person free to devote the entirety of his attention to whatever he sees fit without the oppressive imperatives of the pleasure unconscious bearing down on him since they are already satisfied in addition these emotions are capable of providing a greater pleasure than can be attained from any other source indeed these emotions provide the highest peaks that human beings are capable of experiencing drugs may have a similar effect but most drugs have a draining influence on attention and cognition in addition to providing free pleasure the social factor as the astute reader may have noticed i made little or no mention of interpersonal interaction anywhere in this book in all five examples with which we started the persons were isolated and stuck to try and deal with their problems all on their own there is a very good reason for this the fact is it is precisely those social factors the influences other people have on our own experiences and motivations that play by far the greatest role in obscuring from our consciousness the ever present push and pull of the pleasure unconscious that is because interpersonal relations are rife with emotions and other pleasures and displeasures the influences of which most of us generally take for granted there is almost always some kind of complex motivation in social conditions we may try to make other people laugh or they may do so to us there are plenty of opportunities to be engrossed in conversation we may feel anxiety about disappointing some people or being criticized by them we may attempt to act on our sexual attraction to someone or at least contemplate how to we may find ourselves having to acquiesce to group activities we re lured to take part in or have fun in group activities we truly enjoy and in general the process of social interaction contains many aspects of an involved and exciting activity because most people are in these situations constantly and for the major part of their lives they almost always observe themselves acting in rather reasonable situation directed ways that is because the motivation from social situations is plentiful and powerful and intricate humans are after all social animals leaving people with little mind to consider the most fundamental psychological factors which underlie their behavior and besides human beings are quite poorly equipped to introspect in the first place it is when a person finds himself free from most or all social influences that he usually comes to discover in himself a great lack of motivation to do the things he had earlier considered important without anxiety about fulfilling what others require of him such as at his job or in school or in a family environment or excitement for gaining someone s praise bragging about and showing off his accomplishments or telling stories of his virtuous deeds or the other great variety of pleasures and fulfillments that only interpersonal relations can provide a person will likely find himself utterly dominated by the need to seek pleasure and quickly default to the lowest and easiest pleasures available to him a person left in this way to his own devices and at the unopposed mercy of his pleasure unconscious will likely be consumed by it at least for a while until self revulsion or some other factor eventually pulls him out of it and many people who become mired in such a situation as i have said happened to me truly do eat themselves i mean this figuratively of course chapter 5 the mental framework of motivation we have now for the most part become acquainted with the various nuances of the pleasure unconscious and the ways they manifest themselves in human behavior in understanding how this system functions we can now proceed to develop the methods to control it and to use it to our conscious advantage we will find it enormously helpful however to first examine the psychological framework inside the human mind where all these motivational conflicts actually take place the three parts of a prospective activity it s finally time to pick up the reins of our first investigation in which we divided a prospective task into three distinct parts the actions necessary to begin it the process of the task itself and its consequences these are undoubtedly real psychological stratifications that are an emergent product of the human mind and not just useful categories that we picked arbitrarily to make our descriptive job easier in a person s mind each aspect is treated in its own specific way and usually affects him through a specific kind of pleasure or displeasure i now want to make absolutely clear how this mental process occurs each of the three parts of a future prospective task contributes its own aspect of pleasure or displeasure when a person calls it to mind this occurs because anticipated future or simply imagined actions and scenarios become somewhat real to a person when he thinks about them which renders them capable of evoking pleasure and displeasure in the present 26 of course all feelings of pleasure and displeasure can only be experienced in the present and that is precisely why thoughts of the future like of the prospective tasks we are considering here affect a person on par with the physical sensations he presently derives from external sources in this way the pleasure or displeasure a person feels when he thinks of a task compels him to either take it up or avoid it all via the same fundamental unconscious process by which he or an animal would seek to move from cold shade into warm sunlight but not when doing so would require stepping in filth or exposing oneself to danger the reason this usually serves us well at least in satisfying the imperatives of the pleasure unconscious is that the pleasure or displeasure we anticipate from a task in each of its aspects very strongly corresponds to the actual pleasure or displeasure we stand to experience when we engage in it that is because our anticipations become unconsciously and firmly tied to our past experiences of a similar nature when we engaged in that or a similar activity in the past in other words our anticipations are strongly tied to reality or at least our experiential knowledge of it in fact it is unavoidable that this occurs as we have already mentioned it is virtually impossible for human beings to trick themselves into believing that the consequences of an action will be worse than they actually are such as in self imposed deadlines and the same goes for the pleasure to be had in the act itself we cannot help but represent the future realistically at least to the best of our knowledge there is no doubt that that kind of unconscious representation can be susceptible to flaws and inaccuracies it is and we will discuss some ways in which this happens nevertheless the correlation between actual future experiences and our anticipatory mental representation of them is very high and the more experience we have with a particular activity the more realistically we unconsciously represent it as a prospect it is a completely different story when we have very little or no experience with an activity perhaps only book knowledge then we are prone to represent it completely fictitiously with very little correlation to reality and often with a lot of anxiety besides 27 and although the human mind does still attempt to unconsciously represent an activity the person had zero experience with and knows little or nothing about using as close an experiential analogue as it can find this is usually so far off from an accurate representation of reality that it might as well be completely arbitrary let us now look into the specific types of affect that each constituent of a prospective task generally evokes although it can certainly vary the type of pleasure or displeasure a person experiences in relation to each of the three parts of a future task is most commonly the following for each one 1 starting the task the pleasure factor of beginning a task most often comes from and is generally proportional to and hence a good representation of the effort required to begin it 28 as a result it usually only evokes displeasure since beginning any task requires some amount of effort which is pretty much universally displeasurable 2 the task itself the pleasure factor of the task itself usually derives from the actual experience the person anticipates from the task usually based on his experiences with it in the past 29 it also greatly depends on the pleasure or displeasure the person is currently experiencing we will recall that pleasure is relative 30 generally this amounts to a good representation of the pleasure the person will actually derive from the activity when he engages in it this representation can however be somewhat inaccurate because of a subconscious tendency people have to favor recent experiences over more distant ones and displeasurable experiences over pleasurable ones it is most inaccurate when the person has no first hand experience with the activity at all and bases his anticipation of it on whatever meager information he does or doesn t have in those cases it may be supplemented with the displeasure of anxiety 3 the consequences the pleasure factor of the result of the task is usually emotional the anticipation of the result most frequently evokes either the emotion of excitement or the emotion of anxiety but it can also evoke disgust or an anticipation of relief or a feeling of dread those three dimensions of a prospective task along with their commonly evoked affects are illustrated in figure 2 below it is important to note that in figure 2 we are so to say attempting to represent a three dimensional structure in just two dimensions these three aspects of a task are actually involved in a very real thought process mostly unconscious that occurs in a person s mind when he considers whether or not to take action and during this person s actual thought process all these aspects of a task do not come to his mind all at once rather they appear in succession even if sometimes a very quick one occurring within a timeframe of just a few seconds almost always the first thing that comes to a person s mind is either the notion of the task itself or the idea of its consequences thoughts of what he must do to start the task naturally emerge later furthermore a person does not always consider all three parts of a task before reaching a decision sometimes he will just consider the idea of the activity itself if it is a particularly enjoyable one or its consequences usually when they are especially pressing and that alone will be enough to compel him to undertake it it also isn t uncommon that a person will engage in a task without paying heed to its consequences at all even if he fully knows what they are they simply may not come to his mind at the time or he may deliberately avoid thinking about them an overwhelming majority of the time however all three constituents of a task do come to the person s mind and each plays its part in moving him to engage in the task or refrain from it this is especially so when a person is on the fence for whether to take up a task or not then these three aspects may come to his mind perpetually and he will become occupied with the painful deliberation of weighing the three aspects against one another for instance the person may think of an errand he has to run then imagine how unpleasurable it will be to actually do so and when deciding that the juice is still worth the squeeze finally think of the effort he must exert to begin it and end up doing nothing at all he may often remember this errand namely the consequences of leaving it undone and again and again go through the same thought process and obtain the same result perpetually wallowing in inaction other times the person may consider a pleasurable action then think of its negative consequences and or the steps he must take to begin it and be discouraged from it in the same way to once again end up doing nothing this too is likely to be a perpetually occurring chain of thoughts and also lead in most cases to inaction motivation for continuing the current activity vs beginning a new one in figure 2 we have depicted the pleasure incentive of a prospective activity and we can use that as a model for making rough estimates of how alluring the idea of that new task will be but if we want to be able to predict whether a person will actually take up that activity or not we have to include in our model two other factors 31 this stems from the nuance we mentioned in chapter 2 that starting one activity also means quitting another we can view anything a person is currently doing as an activity even if he s just lying on a couch bored out of his brains this is useful because it lets us gauge how much of his total attention the person is currently employing as well as how much pleasure he is currently experiencing with that we can compare the pleasure and displeasure he derives from his present activity with the gain in pleasure he stands to experience from a prospective one and more importantly it lets us ascertain the consequences of quitting his current activity which certainly play a key motivating role in whether the person does or does not quit it we know for a fact that the procrastinator rushing to write his term paper at the last minute is prevented from switching to a more enjoyable activity by the consequences of doing so failing his class in that case anxiety plays the role of an overseer administering a sharp jolt of painful affect as if slapping his hand away whenever the person considers quitting and switching to another task thus anxiety doesn t just make the person finally begin his assignment but also prevents him from quitting in the middle of doing it we can of course view the consequences of quitting the current activity as just a part of the consequences of beginning a new one but there does exist a psychological distinction between the two within a person s actual thought processes although sometimes the two sets of consequences come to a person s mind simultaneously often a person does think of them separately and regards them subconsciously as two separate entities it may just be a matter of semantics but our depiction in figure 3 below should represent the matter fairly as we have shown in figure 3 a person s manifest behavior of whether he switches from one activity to another depends on the combined pleasure incentive from the three aspects of the prospective task as weighed against the amount of pleasure he derives from his current activity plus the pleasure based consequences of quitting it this will be a good model to refer to in the next chapter in which we will survey and dissect the various psychological tools we can use to influence the pleasure unconscious and thus indirectly control our behavior the role of willpower but looking now at this model we cannot avoid addressing a very important question that s really at the heart of this book what is the role of willpower the understanding of motivational forces that we ve reached and diagramed in figure 3 seems to leave no place for willpower in a person s decision making process surely a human being isn t just an automaton who invariably follows the path of least resistance toward pleasure and lacks any volition of his own what of the people we encounter who are incontrovertibly strong willed consistently able to postpone or forgo pleasure and remain tough in the face of displeasurable adversity what of the abstinent the austere the morally pious who resolutely follow what they think is right and appear to largely disregard their personal discomforts and pleasure lust it does indeed seem that such people have a force of will much greater than the average man making them able to successfully oppose and override the pleasure unconscious that is however almost certainly not the case while humans do have the ability to consciously direct their attention independently of the pleasure unconscious that is what we recognize as willpower and by the principle of human variability we can assume that some persons have a much greater aptitude for this than do others there is no evidence to suspect that this alone constitutes that seeming ability of some people to live outside the laws of the pleasure principle 32 instead every bit of evidence suggests that these people s ability to constantly overcome the pleasure unconscious by sheer force of will is merely an illusion they most likely differ primarily not in their ability to behave contrary to motivation but in the types of motivation they experience and the magnitude of the affect they feel in response to certain situations we know for a fact that those people who most commonly exhibit a willful restraint of their pleasure unconscious based impulses the religiously pious actually do so at least in the vast majority of cases out of anxiety they have a unique anxiety provoking factor that is absent in non religious persons a fear of god we ve already learned that a person feels anxiety in response to consequences he thinks to be real while being utterly unable to conjure up anxiety for consequences he knows will not happen a religious person who believes or is at least wary of the possibility that god exists physically experiences anxiety about committing actions and even having thoughts that are not in accordance with the moral precepts of his religion he really does feel himself being watched and judged by god liable to incur eternal damnation in hell for his actions he fears this just as he would fear a physical axe over his head and just as anxiety for not meeting a deadline motivates a person to act in order to avoid the consequences so does anxiety motivate the religious person to act as he was taught is right lest he incur punishment from god by no means does this person live outside the laws of the pleasure unconscious and it is most clearly by those very laws that he only appears to overcome it by the force of his will a similar factor is also responsible for the seemingly will powered constitutions of many non religious persons even with no fears of otherworldly punishment people may possess unusually strong sources of motivation in their lives usually of a social nature that most others do not 33 also very importantly however people can differ not just in the types of motivation present in their lives but in the magnitude with which they feel the affects usually emotional that motivate them many of the strong willed persons so remarkable for acting on their convictions and not on the dumb impulses of the pleasure unconscious may do so not because they will themselves to but because they feel a particularly intense affect in relation to the consequences of their actions the conflict between our convictions and the pleasure unconscious is after all essentially a conflict between the pleasure incentive of the action itself and of its consequences 34 we can assume by the same principle of human variability that some people experience a more potent emotion than others some may feel a fiercer anger a heavier sadness a brighter happiness a more cutting anxiety and so on this may simply be a part of their inborn genetically determined temperament can we not then suppose that the person we consider strong willed who undertakes a displeasurable task in order to reap its beneficial consequences does this because the idea of its results brings him more pleasure more excitement than those identical consequences would for the average person or when the strong willed person forgoes a pleasurable activity with negative consequences may it not be because he naturally feels a greater anxiety or a more poignant shame and self revulsion this is an emotion i will discuss shortly in anticipation of those consequences than the average person does or maybe such a person inherently experiences less pleasure during the pleasurable activities and less displeasure from the displeasurable ones in any case all these are possibilities and may very well coexist in a single human being since they don t contradict one another perhaps it is the person in whom all or many of these factors are present that we are prone to consider exceptionally strong willed as opposed to a person who only exhibits a strong will in certain isolated areas of his life surely all this accounts much better for the disposition of people who appear to defy the imperatives of the pleasure unconscious through sheer volition there is however no reason to assume that a greater capacity to consciously direct one s attention does not also contribute some modest part to this type of strong willed constitution it likely does but it is almost certainly not capable of being its sole determinant and thus going against the most fundamental and archaic psychological functionality of the pleasure unconscious as for how willpower does affect a person s decision making we ve already mentioned the conditions under which it has freedom of reign and is mostly unrestricted by the pleasure unconscious 1 when there are multiple available activities all of which constitute an increase in pleasure the person can then relatively freely choose between them 2 when the compulsion to increase pleasure has been satisfied already with only a small portion of the person s attention he can then invest his remaining attention as he wishes 3 when the person is experiencing displeasure from multiple sources he is then able to decide which to deal with first all this of course is entirely consistent with our model in figure 3 and being thus reassured of the validity of our model we can proceed to using it as a reference point in the next chapter where we will examine the various techniques at our disposal for influencing the pleasure unconscious to achieve our chosen goals so

combatting the maladaptive behaviors instigated by the pleasure unconscious we will also note which aspect of a current or prospective activity each method affects and how it does so the displeasure of a guilty conscience the first psychological weapon a person has against the detrimental behaviors spurred by his pleasure unconscious is the powerful sense of remorse and self criticism he experiences when he commits an action he disapproves of when he goes against his conscience this is a distinctly unpleasurable feeling produced by the emotion of shame and or guilt in most cases a person instinctually experiences a guilty or shameful remorse during or sometime after committing an action different from what he believes to be the correct one 35 the same negative feeling can also be experienced in anticipation when a person only entertains the idea of committing an action that he morally disapproves of this undoubtedly belongs to the psychological domain of an action s consequences it can be felt while a person is in the middle of a regrettable action such as playing a videogame or masturbating or not going to the gym it then serves as a motivator for quitting that activity and taking up something better it can also be felt in relation to a prospective activity just as a person can feel an anticipatory excitement or relief when he imagines completing a beneficial task so can he feel an anticipatory shame or guilt when he imagines engaging in a task he considers lowly or ignoble this anticipated negative affect then acts as a deterrent against beginning that task in fact the emotion of shame and or guilt is essentially our unconscious mind s pleasure based envoy of our conscious intentions it is what allows those intentions to affect our manifest actions by influencing the pleasure unconscious after all it is precisely with the consequences of our actions that our deliberate intentions and goals are concerned one serious problem is that although the emotions of guilt and shame do serve as demotivators against committing the actions a person wants not to they all too often aren t potent enough to prevent him from committing them we ve all certainly heard of guilty pleasures in the five examples with which we began this book every one of those persons would have felt these negative emotions yet that clearly wasn t enough to stop their detrimental behaviors and in most other similar situations it alone isn t enough either much of the time this emotional response merely backfires it fails to have any physical effect on a person s negative actions but is felt as a residual effect of committing them which only serves to reduce the person s confidence and self esteem nevertheless it is still a very useful source of motivation or rather demotivation toward choosing the activities we know to be good for us and avoiding those that we know aren t and since motivation stacks up it is after all merely a quantitative battle of pleasure versus displeasure it is a step in the right direction and can be supplemented with other sources of motivation that support the same ends keeping the end in mind it is important to mention that because what we consciously desire always coincides with the consequences of our actions it is a big help to actually remember what those consequences are and to keep them in mind when considering a prospective action we already noted that this doesn t always occur and is not entirely automatic so it is a very good idea to make a habit of purposefully recalling the consequences of the actions we are compelled to take up do not weigh pros and cons perhaps one of the greatest anomalies of our rational mind is how it tends to completely acquiesce to the imperatives of the pleasure unconscious if we attempt to approach a problem armed only with the faculty of reason without making use of any fixed beliefs or negative associations our rationale will likely lead often very irrationally to precisely the conclusions that bring us the most pleasure or reduce the most displeasure this is the well known process of rationalization and there is perhaps no time its effects are more blatantly evident than when we attempt to reason out whether a particular course of action is the correct one we naturally do this by weighing the pros and cons of an action against one another and forming our conclusion based on that balance this of course pertains exclusively to the consequences of that action what happens most of the time however is that our deliberations uncannily conform to the compulsions of the pleasure principle leading us to conclude that activities which are pleasurable are also beneficial and the activities which are unpleasurable are not often when this is objectively untrue what occurs psychologically during this weighing of pros and cons is that the pros of a pleasurable action seem at the time to fully justify it even if they are objectively fickle or worthless while the cons seem to be utterly insignificant even if they are objectively great once again we are brought to appreciate the utterly non obvious fact that our mind holds pleasure and displeasure as the main currency of our psychological transactions for example to a tired person lying comfortably in his bed and weighing the pros and cons of getting up and starting on a productive day against remaining in bed and snagging some extra sleep whatever fickle pros of returning to sleep he thinks of the vague health benefits of resting more that he can get the same things done even if he wakes up four hours later that he might be too tired to get anything accomplished that the morning chatter of birds may be too distracting for him to get down to work and so on will carry great weight because they are imbued with the immediately felt and quite substantial pleasure of the comfortable sleep he is drawn to while the pros of getting up the knowledge that waking up early always brings him great satisfaction that he usually works best at this early hour that he has already slept more than enough and will only get more tired from the extra sleep and that the things he can do if he wakes up are the best use of his time while sleeping is objectively worthless will affect him only very little or not at all because he doesn t truly feel the pleasure that comes with them compulsive sexual actions are a particularly common victim of this as a very insightful friend of mine once said in relation to the prospect of having sex with an ex girlfriend whether it is objectively for the best or not i can t trust that at the time i won t be able to convince myself that it would be in these kinds of situations when we are drawn to an action we know to be wrong and that we ll regret later the key isn t attempting to reevaluate whether it s actually so even if we are strongly impelled to for if we do we ll almost invariably find ourselves overwriting our previous convictions and taking up the unintended action as a result in such situations it s best to form our conclusions beforehand and then stick to them remembering that they are more valid than whatever our reasoning will generate in the heat of the moment the power of habit and association to not go through the fallacious process of weighing pros and cons while still making use of the influence of knowing the consequences of our actions it is best to make a strong associative connection between the thought of an action and the thought of its consequences strong associations like this usually take a while to form and require a substantial amount of repetition to do so the process is basically one of forming a habit of thought to deliberately call to mind one thought in relation to another in this case thoughts of the consequences in relation to thoughts of the action after doing so many times the process will become largely automatic the result is a quick association of a displeasurable thought usually an off putting picture or vision imbued with a negative emotion to the pleasurable thought of a detrimental action or it can be the association of a pleasurable thought to that of an unpleasurable action this serves as a kind of immediate pleasure based counterweight to compelling behaviors we know to be detrimental the reason i recommend this kind of association and habit forming is that it is quick and mostly unconscious being unconscious it isn t subject to much conscious scrutiny and reevaluation via the pros and cons process that we know to be so harmful but its biggest advantage is without a doubt its quickness as an automatic reaction since there are many situations where time is a large factor in our decisions of whether to engage in an action or not sometimes we will find ourselves in the middle of an activity before we have any time to think of its imminent consequences and automatic association often works to prevent such behavior there are however times when even a habitual association is too slow to prevent this like in our example with the smoker at the start of this book controlling our environment it may seem an outdated behaviorist notion but the most powerful and effective way to change our behavior is to change our environment this is undoubtedly true however unlike behaviorists we are wise to admit that this is an indirect method of influencing our actions the state of our surroundings has a definite bearing on our thoughts which only then contribute to our behavior nevertheless it is much more effective than trying to control our thoughts directly and deliberately this is nothing new we had already in effect reached this essential conclusion in admitting the following two notions 1 the distribution of our attention and thus the contents of our mind are much more strongly determined by the pleasure unconscious than by any of our deliberate efforts or intentions 2 the pleasure seeking thoughts that do compulsively occupy our mind cannot help but be strongly rooted in reality 36 it follows from this that manipulating our external environment will have profound effects on what activities compel us and what our manifest actions will then be and this proves very true in practice by purposefully manipulating the surroundings in which he lives a person can alter the motivation he derives from any aspect of nearly any activity he can intentionally change his surroundings to make the effort needed to begin a particular task physically greater 37 he can introduce certain factors to make the process of the activity itself a less pleasurable one 38 and he can create various self imposed consequences to an activity to make its results undesirable 39 of course if he wishes to increase his engagement in an activity he can do the exact opposite and make it easier to begin more pleasurable to take part in and have beneficial consequences targeting the process of beginning a task is particularly effective physically changing our surroundings to make that process easier or harder can make all the difference in our manifest actions it can induce us to take up beneficial activities that we otherwise wouldn t have and entice us to refrain from detrimental ones that we d otherwise take up the very notion of doing so however is usually overlooked by most people especially in the case of detrimental activities let us take for example the videogame addict who cannot help but play a particular game whenever he has a moment to himself with what we now know we can say with great certainty that a big factor in his behavior is the easy availability of the game he needs to exert virtually no effort to begin playing it except perhaps turning on his computer if even that what would happen then if he takes preventative measures and stores his videogame cartridge in a safe box two miles away from his home he would certainly still pine for the game since the thought of playing it brings him pleasure but then he ll have no choice but to imagine the long walk to the safe box and back which he needs to take in order to play it and most likely not go sometimes he ll get dressed and ready to go to the safe box but then he ll remember that he is trying to quit the game and that that would be pathetic and not go sometimes he ll make it halfway to the safe box but then turn around and go back sometimes he ll make it there and hold the game in his hands but then decide against it and sometimes he will actually succumb make the entire journey there and back and end up playing the game despite everything but in total he will play the game incredibly less often than he would if it was already in his computer and eventually since he is deprived of it the impulse will slowly fade as we can see from this example the time aspect also plays a large preventative role in these kinds of scenarios if manipulating one s environment has the additional effect of not only making the start of an activity require more effort but also more time the person will have more opportunities to think over and consider the consequences of whether he really wants to go through with it or not and thus have more chances to bow out indeed there are many activities especially those that only require a click or two on the computer that require so little time and effort to start that the person doesn t have even a moment to think of the consequences or of anything really before he finds himself right in the middle of one of course the same principle works in the other direction as well a person can preemptively reduce the time and effort needed to start an activity and thus be more enticed to actually take it up 40 somebody who has to spend a lot of time traveling to somewhere he wants to go will invariably be deterred from it for that reason if a person must every time clean a bunch of clutter off of his desk and struggle to plug his lamp into a hard to reach socket so he can make space to read a book even one that he s excited to read he will invariably be deterred from doing so if he preemptively cleans his desk and gets an extension cord for his lamp however he will no longer be inhibited by this in his ambitions to read and be much more compelled to actually do it 41 the main trick to making these kinds of prophylactic changes to our environment is first realizing where such changes need to be made and then deliberately making them at a time estranged from the activity that calls for them the video gamer will find it very hard if not impossible to store away his videogame at the moment when he cannot even resist playing it and the person who wants to read a book but is unable to even overcome the effort needed to clear his desk in order to do so will certainly not go further still and put in an even larger effort setting up his environment so he can make his future reading attempts easier this is really the main reason why people go without making such useful changes for so long and so often fail to do so entirely it is that they are only confronted with the idea of making such a change when they are defeated by the situation that calls for it in other words at the precise time when they want the exact opposite once the person has already refrained from the compulsion of an activity that required too much effort to start or succumbed to an activity that was instead too easy to start he loses the immediate need to change those conditions and most often puts the notion of it out of his mind until he is once again confronted with the activity that calls for it the result is that people perpetually butt up against the same motivational problems of starting an activity and never do anything to change them the solution of course is to realize that those changes do need to be made and that they would be decidedly beneficial then keeping that in mind deliberately making those changes at a miscellaneous time when one has enough motivation to do so it is when the video gamer is morally repulsed with playing the game or tired of it for the meantime that he should take the opportunity to lock it away instead of as most people do simply forming a resolution to not play it later a resolution that is almost invariably broken similarly it is when the reader is feeling industrious cheery that he would be best to go out of his way and improve the reading conditions on his desk treating this as a necessary chore it is important to reiterate that most people only experience such a total paralysis before taking proactive actions to change their surroundings if they were never able to overcome those surroundings in the first place it is the reader who can never overcome the activation energy of clearing his table in order to read who is most likely to never make any preemptive changes to make it easier and it is the video gamer who can never resist playing his game anytime he s compelled to who is most likely to not lock it away on the contrary however the reader who does frequently or at least occasionally overcome the needed effort of clearing his table and the video gamer who fervently tries and sometimes succeeds in resisting his impulses to play the game are actually very likely to take the necessary prophylactic measures and to change their environments to accommodate their goals to those who have to physically experience displeasure in the effort of starting or refraining from a task because they have to go through that same displeasurable process every time they do so it is actually quite natural and automatic for them to seek and take measures to make their experience more agreeable the reader who constantly finds himself spending time and effort clearing his desk before reading will naturally find a way to make this process permanently easier the video gamer who in being drawn to his game perpetually and painfully fights his own impulses in order to avoid playing it will likely support those efforts by physically doing something to help himself in that battle and soon lock away or otherwise dispose of the game it is in cases where people do not actually go through the displeasurable effort of starting or refraining from a task and are instead defeated by it that they are prone not to facilitate their struggles by improving their surroundings and to not even realize that doing so would make a difference but unfortunately such cases are plenty a second similar method of changing one s environment to change one s motivation is targeting the pleasure or displeasure derived from the task itself the activity of hiking may be inherently enjoyable to a person but it will be much less so if not entirely a pain when he is doing so in ill fitting shoes that create and continuously aggravate painful blisters on his feet if he has only those shoes available he will be greatly discouraged from going hiking altogether because he will anticipate it as an uncomfortable and painful process getting comfortable shoes of course immediately fixes this problem both practically and motivationally and people are actually very keen on making these kinds of physical changes in their lives ones that make desired or required activities easier or more pleasurable 42 it is making these kinds of helpful changes but in the negative direction that most people have a very hard time wrapping their minds around for example to purposely leave oneself with only uncomfortable shoes if one s goal is to not go hiking or more practically to deliberately buy only bland tasteless food if one s goal is to eat less or to intentionally make the conditions in one s home uncomfortable and unaccommodating if one s goal is to spend more time outdoors that very notion of purposefully making life harder for oneself is met with substantial resistance by most people and is in general completely counterintuitive the average person will consider the idea of doing so absurd and resolve to battle with his unhealthy compulsions through his personal willpower without resorting to such ridiculous measures of course we know that these efforts through willpower are extremely fickle and almost invariably doomed to fail especially when the person butts up against the same motivational conditions every time on the other hand there is no doubt that our alternative method of physically changing the environment is directly effective and reliably yields great practical results lastly a similar change in motivation can be effected by targeting the physical consequences of various actions this method is not at all an automatic modus operandi for most people in general people accept and deal with the set consequences of their actions prescribed by their surroundings it is however possible for a person to personally manipulate and create consequences for his actions and this will inevitably have an effect on his future motivation and behavior most often this is achieved through the imposition of monetary consequences a wager is a quintessential example of this a person striving to reach a difficult goal or complete a task building a porch or losing weight for instance will be wise to supplement his motivation to do so by making a bet on it with a friend he would of course bet in favor of himself and in doing so he will receive both a positive incentive to complete the task his desire to collect the reward for winning the bet and a negative disincentive to quit the task his desire to avoid having to pay out if he loses of course the more money he bets the more motivation he will receive assuming he finds someone willing to bet against him on the other hand the repercussion free bets that are commonly deemed friendly bets will have little to no motivational impact because they impose no consequences 43 of course consequences and even bets are not restricted to monetary ones one interesting kind of consequence a person can impose on himself is an automatic exposure to embarrassment if he wishes to not take part in an activity he is ashamed of and would be embarrassed if he did and his friends found out he could set up conditions that would make it impossible for him to hide his behavior from those friends today there are many online applications that can be used to accomplish this ones that automatically post your activity on social media or allow people access to your browser history and so forth such tactics really do work since a person will anticipate the unavoidable embarrassment that would result from his actions and be more motivated to refrain from them instead it does indeed seem that nearly all self imposed consequences to one s actions require the involvement of other people to be enacted all wagers undoubtedly require someone to wager with the same is true for all situations in which a person relinquishes a certain power over himself to another to be exercised if he engages in or fails to perform certain actions 44 so too for situations in which one person is voluntarily sponsored by another who then rewards him for performing virtuous deeds and refraining from detrimental ones those are after all essentially one sided wagers where the person exposes himself to either just risk without reward or just reward without risk 45 and that covers just about the whole spectrum of self imposable consequences pretty much excluding only those analogous to an automated electronic device that hits you with an electric shock every time you pick your nose or some kind of demented mechanical contraption that lowers a boulder hanging above your car a few centimeters every time you masturbate i want to make one final point about changing the physical environment around you to curb the unwanted yet compulsive behaviors instigated by the pleasure unconscious it is that the tides of the mind are turbulent a person s mind is subject to undergo drastic changes in mood cognizance pleasure lust and other factors affecting his motivational state even over the course of one day there will be times when he experiences compulsions that are too strong to resist and times when his power to consciously resist them is too weak there are indeed moments of great temptation and moments of utter weakness before it there are moments of complete irrationality and moments when rationality is impotent there are great tide changing bursts of emotion and times of insufferable boredom and they all occur sporadically and inevitably in the microcosm of one human mind any changes we try to make in our thinking in an effort to curb our unhealthy compulsions will therefore be vulnerable to a variety of insubordinate forces from within which will usurp or override our conscious cognition and volition and cede control of our actions to the more basic archaic systems in our mind we should now be aware after all that we have astoundingly less control over our own minds than we initially thought and the times when we are in control are only those in which the pleasure unconscious allows us to be we also know the kind of ill mental health and neurosis that can arise in the person who attempts to guard against his subconscious compulsions at all costs by means of only his conscious faculties 46 this person is implicitly aware of the erratic nature of his mind viscerally experiencing as he does the moments when his forbidden impulses are chomping at the bit to be acted on and when his mind is ready to betray him this kind of man truly doesn t trust his own mind 47 he will indeed have to be constantly on guard against those times as well and usually this results in a huge restriction of his activities usually via anxiety since he must defend against situations in which he may succumb to his own impulses resulting symptoms are likely to be something along the lines of agoraphobia paranoia and obsessive compulsive disorder 48 but while changes in one s mental state are sporadic and our control of them tenuous the physical environment around us is practically static and our control over it is only restricted by our physical limitations we can make resolutions to behave a certain way and it is uncertain whether we ll even remember them let alone be able to act on them when the time comes but once we change something in our surroundings it is bound to stay that way barring some rare external forces a person who s made a resolution to read the next time he wants to watch tv may even when he is utterly bored have the very notion that there s an opportunity to do so entirely slip his mind or be unable to act on it even if he does remember 49 on the other hand what will help him keep his resolution when he wishes to watch tv is butting up against the cold hard reality that his tv isn t there because he stored it in his closet and replaced it with a book two days earlier many unhealthy compulsions are in this way capable of being nullified when the opportunity to act on them is made physically unavailable 50 employing social motivation you can make good use of the motivation derived from other people in helping the vicissitudes of your pleasure unconscious conform to your conscious goals 1 doing things with a friend can make otherwise dull activities exciting and fun instead this can be implemented to make starting activities easier or less unpleasurable what would otherwise be a long boring commute can be an enjoyable time if you make it with friends 2 it can make activities themselves more pleasurable working out or putting together a presentation can be made much more enjoyable with a social aspect added to it 3 social aspects can also contribute to the consequences of certain actions promising a friend that you will do something will make you anxious about failing to follow through and thus much more likely to actually do it the incentive to appear virtuous in front of friends can motivate you to actually behave more virtuously in turn rivalries and competitions are often a great source of motivation for bettering yourself working at something and doing the best you can to excel at it there is without a doubt an abundance of possibilities to use the social motivation we naturally derive from other people to reach our deliberate goals splitting your attention we ve already mentioned that we can subdue the wants of the pleasure unconscious by using tactics of divide and conquer the compulsion to increase pleasure can be satisfied and put at bay with only a small portion of our attention leaving the rest of it free at our disposal we can then devote that attention to productive if tedious tasks like cleaning cooking exercising and so on without the normal aversion to their unpleasurable nature since we are already receiving pleasure from elsewhere this method pertains of course to the process of the activity itself splitting our attention between 1 mundane and not very involved tasks and 2 some enjoyable but similarly uninvolving activity not only makes those former tasks effectively pleasurable or more pleasurable but also allows us to mobilize the whole of our available attention another big striving of our unconscious mind effective sources of pleasure that don t consume much attention include listening to music playing some mechanical game chewing gum or eating a tasty food or beverage people commonly partake in these in conjunction with necessary and largely unpleasurable daily activities in order to make them more bearable this is a great method for activities that don t require much attention to perform however it is inherently unsuitable for mentally involving activities that necessitate one s full attention to carry out these include reading writing mathematics and so forth since it is likely to distract from those activities instead 51 but it is important to watch out even during just partially engrossing tasks that the pleasant activities you supplement them with don t take up too much of your total attention and render you unable to devote the amount required to the actually important primary activity for example a person who multitasks by playing solitaire and listening to a speech may find that while he was initially managing the two tasks well together the solitaire is beginning to take up too much attention this can happen for a variety of reasons and he is missing a lot of the speech or the person who listens to music while writing may find that his mind starts to stray too often from the writing and becomes more and more consumed by the music directing your attention i wish to touch here upon a point i made at the end of chapter 3 we know that humans have the conscious ability to direct their attention but most times it is overpowered by the attention drawing power of the pleasure unconscious mostly ceding attention to prospects of pleasure and manifest affects of displeasure however because perceiving pleasure and displeasure also requires attention we can actually direct our attention consciously in order to manipulate the magnitude of our affects and thus the pleasure unconscious we can exploit this ability in situations when we are simultaneously experiencing multiple sources of pleasure and or displeasure and use it to propel actions that are in closer accordance with our conscious goals it is possible to deliberately sink our attention into a particular source of pleasure or displeasure and thus make it more intense and if that attention is transferred from other sensations of pleasure or displeasure it will also serve to make those sensations less intense just as a mild itch gets significantly more uncomfortable when we think precisely about it and we then become extremely compelled to scratch it despite consciously knowing that it would only do us harm so can we consciously direct our attention toward a small pleasure or displeasure and use it to overcome a much greater and fiercer affect for example a person who consciously wants to get out of bed but is paralyzed by the pure physical pleasure of remaining in it can leverage a slight displeasure to propel him to get up if he feels a slight amount of discomfort or strain in his rib tiny in magnitude compared to the pleasure of lying in bed he can direct his attention only at that tiny displeasure and use it as a fulcrum by which to extract himself from his nest 52 this method pertains of course to the pleasure or displeasure derived from a present activity employing emotion emotions are great sources of motivation and usually yield powerful amounts of pleasure or displeasure and we can harness the abundant motivating power of emotions by consciously redirecting it toward productive behaviors emotions are by their nature malleable and while they instinctually motivate towards a specific type of action like causing some harm to the person anger is directed at the actual actions that we choose can be to a large extent determined by our conscious mind for example a person angry at his wife for slighting him can seek his revenge by insulting her destroying or defacing her possessions or possibly even causing her physical harm 53 he can also suppress his anger and incur a substantial amount of stress these are clearly bad alternatives he can however consciously channel his anger into a productive task like setting up his fishing gear finally replacing the tire on his bike or some other manual task required for a hobby of his through which he can temporarily get away from his spouse this will still get revenge on her in a way and so at least partially satisfy his anger and in return the anger will serve as motivation to do what would otherwise be a boring and unpleasurable task this method of rechanneling emotions is applicable to positive emotions in addition to negative ones but with a key difference negative emotions like anger or shame can be redirected toward productive ends but only if those ends also satisfy the emotion s natural instinctive compulsions like getting revenge or making amends positive emotions like happiness and excitement however are not restricted to being redirected towards a particular purpose since they are for the most part ends in themselves they are free pleasure happiness does subconsciously draw a person to dwell and reminisce upon its source and excitement subconsciously pulls the person to plan and contemplate the idea that excites him but at the same time both are residual sources of free pleasure and the person can take up any other task instead and find it fairly pleasurable because he is already experiencing pleasure from those emotional chemical sources in the case of negative emotions this method of redirecting an emotion pertains to the consequences of an action since it is the result of the action the man getting away from his wife where the satisfaction lies in the case of positive emotions however it pertains to the process of the action itself since that action now becomes and is anticipated to be more pleasurable due to the free pleasure derived from those emotions the power of imagination the next method is an extremely crucial one and has a particular psychological importance it pertains to the start of an activity when starting an activity requires only physical movement such as getting off the couch or putting on clothes or entering the water at the beach the simple technique of imagining yourself physically performing those movements has the uncanny effect of compelling you to actually execute them we know that even the simplest actions necessary to start a task like getting up off the couch and moving oneself to a writing desk can be incredibly hard to overcome for the person who lacks sufficient motivation to do the actual task they start and even when his motivation is sufficient or when it is a close call between beginning that new action or not the activation energy of those simple physical movements especially if they are displeasurable like getting up off a comfortable couch will often be enough to inhibit that person from taking any action at all but this activation energy can be easily overcome without incurring any displeasure through the power of imagination the trick is to deliberately and in detail imagine yourself best in first person performing the physical movements you need to make this includes imagining how you will move your arms your legs your body and so forth it generally takes a second or two to imagine this and after you do you ll soon find yourself perhaps to your own surprise automatically springing into action and performing those movements without giving it any further thought and exerting practically no effort this usually occurs upon taking your mind off the subject give this a try it is a truly odd trick and works as a shortcut to overcoming the activation energy of many activities i see two reasons why this works the first is that after imagining yourself performing physical movements your body experiences a sort of uncomfortable tension if it doesn t actually execute them by way of the pleasure principle you then seek to perform those movements to relieve that tension the second reason is that imagining actions particularly movements before performing them is the standard modus operandi of the connection between your body and mind consider the times when in walking somewhere you automatically make it all the way there along a certain path without giving it any thought whatsoever this is invariably because on the start of your journey you imagined for a brief second sometimes entirely subconsciously the path to that exact location this is most noticeable when you accidently end up at the wrong place when you decide in the middle of your journey to go elsewhere but fail to trace that route out in your mind and end up at the initial destination only to then realize that you no longer have a reason to be there also consider the times you automatically without giving it any thought perform all the actions necessary to go to the bathroom or retrieve food from the fridge and only become cognizant of the fact that you did so when you are in the middle of peeing or eating it is because you invariably traced the route and actions out in your mind before doing so the same phenomenon occurs when you contemplate saying something during a conversation maybe an offensive comment and finally conclude to withhold saying it only to suddenly find yourself blurting it out anyway during some opportune moment caffeine and other drugs we ve already mentioned the free pleasure that can be attained through chemical means using various drugs and substances many drugs have the effect of free pleasure which is what makes them so attractive in the first place with the additional effect that they also restrict attention and or cognition alcohol for example is one such drug if you are set on a task that requires a high level of cognitive work and available attention it is not a good idea to drink alcohol for motivational purposes it is okay however for rudimentary tasks like chores around the house there are however some drugs that provide free pleasure without having any detrimental effects on cognition caffeine and tobacco are popular examples of this and they are very effective substances 54 we can think of the effect of caffeine or tobacco as being the chemical equivalent of listening to music without devoting any attention to doing so in undertaking a large effortful and generally unpleasant task it is often extremely helpful to do so with the help of caffeine and even tobacco these two also have the added benefit of bringing physical pleasure in the action of ingesting them drinking coffee for instance brings pleasure because it tastes good and smoking a cigarette or chewing chewing tobacco brings pleasure because the act of doing so is physically satisfying making use of drugs in this way pertains clearly to the activity itself making a current activity more pleasurable and a prospective one appear more pleasurable 55 frustrate a need another interesting motivational technique is frustrating a present need or desire and using it instead as a reward for a less desirable action hunger a want of leisure the desire for a cigarette sexual impulses and the like can yearn for satisfaction and distract you from your present task this call to satisfaction however can be repurposed to be not a deterrent but an incentive the trick is to reframe it in your mind not as an alternative to your current activity but as a reward you will procure after completing it this is achieved by setting a concrete goal to reach in whatever task you are currently working on writing a certain number of pages or cleaning a certain part of the house or finishing a particular assignment and so forth and resolving to reward yourself with the satisfaction of the desire you re belaying after you meet this goal setting up your environment to facilitate this type of future reward over immediate satisfaction is also very helpful to this end 56 this method is pretty effective but should be used sparingly since it generally causes a person to incur a fair deal of stress also belaying things like hunger can cause detrimental biological effects as well the aspects of a task it pertains to are the current activity from which it removes negative affects at least partially and the consequences of the activity to which it adds the incentive of satisfying a desire the effect is turning a displeasurable distraction from a current activity into additional motivation for completing it monitor your attention capacity it is very important that in your attempts to intelligently modulate the motivation for achieving your goals you be aware not only of your current states of motivation but also of your capacity for attention your total attention capacity varies quite significantly over the course of a day being influenced by factors including tiredness digestion and blood sugar some activities require a truly large amount of attention for example solving difficult physics problems reading dense literature or programming a complex application if you simply do not have enough attention at your disposal to devote to a task no amount of motivation can help you plus the activity is bound to quickly become displeasurable because you are unable to successfully perform it it also helps to be aware of your attention capacity in cases where you have too much available attention for a task you are engaged in then the task is bound to become quickly boring due to an excess of attention and you will be compelled toward something more pleasurable at that point you will be good to append a supplemental preferably pleasurable activity like listening to music to your current one or seek a different and more involving activity altogether monitoring your capacity for attention takes some practice but it is something you ll likely become able to do well over time being aware of your attention and acting accordingly pertains to the current activity you are engaged in it helps determine the reasons why it is unpleasurable begin the day with low pleasures one of the best times you have for taking up a productive and complicated activity is shortly after you wake up it is most common that a person wakes up in the morning in a neutral state of pleasure experiencing no pleasure or displeasure or even experiencing some residual pleasure from sleep at that time he can take up any activity that is at all pleasurable even very slightly since that still constitutes a gain in pleasure if he experiences residual pleasure from having slept well or a good mood from waking up to a gorgeous new day he can fairly easily take up even unpleasant activities in that case one of the worst things he can do is default to a highly pleasurable entertaining and useless activity such as watching tv or playing a videogame doing so if even for just a few minutes will set a precedent of pleasure from which it ll be extremely difficult to move on to a more demanding and less pleasurable task of course the case of waking up is just a good example of a neutral or slightly positive state of pleasure and starting the day with a highly pleasurable activity does not mean that the rest of that day is condemned to being entirely consumed by frivolous and highly pleasurable occupations there are many things a person can do to restore himself to a neutral state of pleasure such as going for a walk or taking a shower or having a meal or a nap or meditation but it also isn t uncommon that a pleasurable activity at the beginning of the day will snowball into a whole day wasted on immoderate leisure in any case we can conclude it a terrible idea to at any time preface a productive and not too pleasurable activity with a frivolous and more pleasurable one this often works to discourage the person from taking up his initially intended task altogether and may lead to a whole day of procrastination it should also be noted that for the times when or people who wake up in a state of displeasure their head hurts or their bones ache or they are feeling generally groggy beginning the day with a productive and not very pleasurable activity is likely to be unsuccessful their main motivation then would be to get rid of their displeasure and in that case starting the day with a pleasurable light hearted activity may on the contrary be the best course of action as long as it does relieve their displeasure and gets them ready for a productive undertaking this includes watching an entertaining and stimulating video to relieve tiredness or grogginess and taking a walk or a hot shower to relieve bodily pain this method of pleasure modulation pertains to the pleasure incentive of the activity itself in a prospective activity it is rooted in the relativity of pleasure which makes slightly pleasurable activities attractive to a person in a neutral that is a bored state but unattractive to one who s already experiencing or has just experienced a greater amount of pleasure from some other activity using physical reminders it should be clear now that a major requirement for achieving your conscious goals despite the unruly tides of the pleasure unconscious is matching each of your mental states that is the cognitive and attention capacity you currently have and the pleasure or displeasure you re currently feeling with the productive tasks you are able to accomplish in those mental states an often unforeseen obstacle to this however is the inadvertent failure of our memory to cooperate with us in this regard most of us experience moments when all our most urgent tasks are out of the way and we have the time motivation and cognitive capacity to do something productive but we can t think of anything we can do then after squandering that opportunity on idle leisure we remember a whole flood of low priority tasks and obligations such as watching a lecture answering an email starting a side project or making a modest improvement in our living conditions that we ve been intending to do or neglecting for a long while the problem is that for most of us and for all but a few of our most important activities our minds won t reliably remind us of the things we ve been planning to do during the moments we can actually do them luckily the best solution s an extremely simple one to set up reminders in our physical environment as a supplement to our memory as a quick rule if we can assist or replace a mental task our productivity depends on with some physical instrument it is probably a good idea in this case a whiteboard installed in a prominent location in one s home or workplace performs this task perfectly by writing down everything that you want or need to do whenever it enters your consciousness which truly requires minimal effort you create an external memory aide that you cannot avoid looking at over the course of the day then when you are at a loss for something productive to do you can simply refer back to the whiteboard and view all the options laid out before you which is certainly a lot easier and more effective than racking your brains over the matter and better still because the new scribbles on it will involuntarily catch your eye you ll be reminded of your various short term goals even when you don t realize you could be doing something productive potentially converting what would ve been idle leisure into a valuable accomplishment it is important to make sure however that there is a steady turnover in the material on your whiteboard meaning that you are frequently erasing old tasks after completing them and writing in new ones otherwise if you simply fill the whiteboard with tasks you ll never erase it will quickly become just another piece of ignored furniture which you will fail to even notice because of its sheer familiarity it is after all novelty in your surroundings that instinctively draws your attention while familiar things are unconsciously overlooked to put it a different way your whiteboard is best used for short term tasks and won t be too helpful for long term ongoing ones aside from a whiteboard you can use sticky notes or a to do list app for the same purpose but the sticky notes may be too small to read from a distance while the to do list app needs to be opened from some digital device which in itself requires effort i think the whiteboard which catches our eyes easily and automatically is the best tool we have here this method pertains to the overall pleasure incentive of a prospective activity it brings to our mind prospective activities that might already compel us enough to undertake them but that we otherwise wouldn t have merely because we forgot about their existence chapter 7 applying what we learned now we can finally return to the examples with which we began this book and see if with our newfound knowledge we are now able to suggest ways to help those people out of their motivational predicaments the procrastinator let us begin with jim the procrastinator he is unable to write the paper assigned to him without leaving it to the last minute before his deadline which causes him great stress and results in a poorer product so where does jim s motivational problem lie the first thing that should be absolutely clear to us is that the very act of writing his paper is anticipated as distinctly unpleasurable by jim his level of dread for the activity cannot be exactly determined but we can say with full certainty that if the thought of writing the paper is not for him imbued with intense displeasure it is at least nearly or completely devoid of all pleasure the negative consequences of the action do provide jim with some motivation for carrying it out but as we mentioned earlier they don t really take hold until the last minute and are before then more likely to cause jim to put off writing the paper than to actually write it we can assume that the effort for beginning this task is miniscule and requires nothing more than turning on a computer and opening microsoft word we will thus direct our efforts to attacking this problem on the process and the consequences front as not much can be done to make beginning this activity any easier the first thing we want to know is whether there s any way to make the process of writing this paper or rather jim s anticipation of it at least slightly pleasurable for this it s good to first address any miscellaneous factors that may cause the task to appear disproportionately more displeasurable than it really is in this type of scenario a person s failure to adequately imagine what he must actually do during the task commonly serves as such a deterrent very often a person s dread before a large seemingly insurmountable task or his anxiety from the notion that he might be unable to do it or do it poorly imbue the idea of the activity with more displeasure than it physically warrants this can be resolved by planning out the activity before attempting to tackle it head on and breaking it down into smaller more manageable and more imaginable pieces jim can break the activity of writing his paper into a few separate parts of one section or one topic each and this will allow him to more easily imagine what he needs to do for each one and thus eliminate any unnecessary dread and anxiety that he may experience before the whole task but not its smaller constituents of course since jim can only write one section at a time this won t make his job any harder physically minus perhaps the effort it takes him to section and plan it but it will make his job a lot easier psychologically next it is extremely important that we advise jim not to begin his attempts at writing with any pleasurable or entertaining activities whether to prepare himself for writing or some similar misguided reason since we know that this will have precisely the opposite effect seeing to that we can make additionally sure that the process of writing is not relatively displeasurable by advising jim to devote the select times when he is in a good or neutral mood expressly to writing his paper keeping a whiteboard to remind him that working on the paper is an option during these times is likewise a good idea however even if jim does everything possible to make sure the activity of writing his paper does not appear displeasurable by way of relativity it will do little good if the actual physical process of writing it remains distinctly unpleasurable 57 since we can do nothing to change the natural process of writing or the content of what jim has to write we have to look for auxiliary ways to make this process more pleasurable assuming that this will require all of jim s attention we cannot use music for this purpose the best weapon jim has here is undoubtedly caffeine which will provide him with free pleasure that will soothe and allay the inherent displeasure he experiences from writing his assignment drinking coffee right before or during his attempts to write is therefore highly advisable and likely to be very effective 58 writing the paper alongside a friend is another great means to make the process more enjoyable it may even make it easier if the friend makes good suggestions for what jim should write assuming that we implement all the above it s likely that we ll still only manage to render jim s task merely neutral in pleasure or still slightly displeasurable but that s okay because there s still a whole untapped source of motivation jim can make use of in the domain of the action s consequences there are various ways that jim can artificially provide consequence motivation for himself here making a bet with a friend even a one sided bet is certainly a good one making optimistic claims or promises about finishing the paper early and then deliberately subjecting himself to his friends scrutiny is another he can also try frustrating a need like watching tv hanging out with friends getting drunk or having sex and then incentivize himself using the satisfaction of that need as a reward for completing some fixed amount of work on his paper these combined motivational factors should make jim able to work on his paper without placing himself under the axe of its due date but if even this proves insufficient then perhaps leaving it until the last minute really is the best option since it s likely that nothing other than an impending catastrophe will be enough to motivate this person to work at least on this particular assignment there s still one caveat we ve yet to address however assuming that jim does follow our advice and it does provide him with enough motivation to write his assignment without procrastinating until the very last moment it doesn t automatically follow that he will make any meaningful progress on it it is possible indeed even likely that shortly after beginning jim will switch from writing the paper to a more pleasurable task and then be totally unable to resume his work it is one thing to start a task and another to persist at that task without quitting after just five or ten minutes but we know exactly how to address this problem here we have the quintessential problem of modulating a person s motivation so that he refrains from swapping his current activity for a more pleasurable prospective one we already know that this is a matter of having the pleasure of one s present activity plus the consequences of quitting it outweigh the pleasure incentive of all three dimensions the activation energy the act and the result of the prospective activity refer to figure 3 above since we ve already done everything we could to make the current activity as pleasurable as possible and its consequences as significant as possible our only remaining option is to cut down the promise of pleasure contained in every other activity fortunately this doesn t require jim to perform the same kind of motivational manipulations detailed above to literally every activity more pleasurable than writing his paper all he needs is to seclude himself from those activities what will enable jim to persist at his task without swapping it for a more pleasurable one is simply keeping all such activities out of his reach so that the effort now needed to begin those activities makes doing so an unattractive prospect working in a setting devoid of any opportunities for those activities a library or a basement for instance is the standard potent way of accomplishing this but this doesn t have to go nearly as far as complete seclusion often something as simple as unplugging one s tv or internet creates enough of an effort barrier to prevent a person from abandoning his work for those activities with that we can close the book on jim if he follows our advice he will be very likely to succeed and that is the best we can do for him the gym goer let s now turn our attention to annemarie who cannot find the motivation to go to the gym and work out annemarie s situation encounters motivational problems on all three fronts first just making her way to the gym requires that she leaves her house and travels some distance to get there we do not know exactly how far she has to travel but in any case it undoubtedly requires a non negligible amount of effort second the process of working out is itself bound to be at least partially displeasurable since it certainly causes physical pain and is likely to be monotonous as well and third the consequences of actually working out are no longer concrete for annemarie we can assume that in the first several weeks when she diligently attended the gym every day she was mostly motivated by the desired consequences of doing so but after not seeing much significant results after that time those consequences ceased seeming real to her and transitioned into more of an abstract possibly unreachable goal essentially she lost that aspect of her motivation plus it s also likely that the physical activity of working out became more monotonous and displeasurable for her over time 59 because the effort annemarie must exert to get to the gym is an issue of distance she can t do much to reduce the actual amount of effort that action requires she can nevertheless find ways to reduce its displeasure listening to music or an audiobook while walking to the gym is a great standard way to make that walk more enjoyable and making the trip with a friend will yield the same effect another thing annemarie can do is use the opportunity to go to the gym when she s already made the journey there for another reason like when she s passing by the gym on her way back from her friend s house or when she has more than one reason for making that journey like to buy groceries at a good supermarket next to her gym because hers isn t a one and done task however but something she has to do on an ongoing basis jotting it down on a whiteboard will likely prove ineffective as she ll simply get used to this written reminder and soon cease to notice it to make the actual process of working out more pleasurable annemarie can utilize much of the same resources listening to music while working out would certainly help make the process more enjoyable but there s a good chance this alone won t be sufficient to make the activity pleasurable as a whole listening to an audiobook might do the trick but since that usually requires a person s undivided attention it s more likely to distract annemarie from the actual process of working out and cause her to do so only halfheartedly working out with a friend is probably the best option here adding a social aspect to the activity will go a long way to making it enjoyable without producing any drain on actual performance another option is taking one of the many workout supplements on the market today which are essentially drugs that provide free chemical pleasure and possibly even inhibit some physical pain in order to tackle the monotony and physical discomfort of working out however i do not know how advisable such products are for one s long term health while it is doubtful whether we can do anything to restore annemarie s original eagerness for the results of working out at least until she sees significant results from doing so we can still supply her consequence motivation from elsewhere if she s already taken our advice and works out with a friend that itself is a fruitful source of consequence motivation then failing to go to the gym also becomes letting her friend down which may be further enhanced with feelings of guilt and embarrassment if she doesn t want to appear lazy or pathetic in front of that friend getting a personal trainer is another great option perhaps if annemarie is unable to find a friend to frequent the gym with her or if that friend doesn t provide enough motivation on his or her own a personal trainer serves essentially the same motivating role as a gym buddy only with greater intensity since they tend to be angrier and judge more critically than just some miscellaneous friend 60 and of course annemarie can also make a wager with someone that she ll attend the gym which is always a good source of additional consequence motivation once annemarie amasses enough motivation to go to the gym we don t need to worry much about preventing her from quitting her workout and switching to a more pleasurable activity for one thing the gym is a fairly secluded place and all such activities are likely far out of her reach additionally if she attends the gym with a friend or personal trainer simply quitting in the middle of a workout is a very unsavory option since she will have to incur a good amount of negative emotion whether it be embarrassment or anxiety or shame if she leaves without notifying them or from having to explain herself before them i think that covers all the issues in this scenario and with that we can do no more here the smoker john the smoker is a particularly interesting case the majority of people are likely to think that his situation is fundamentally different from our other examples since his addiction to cigarettes is at least in part physical while the problems in our other cases seem to be entirely psychological we who are now aware of the true nature of motivation should know that this distinction is superficial a person who is said to be psychologically addicted to a substance or activity consistently seeks it out from a want of pleasure a person who is said to be physically addicted to what is nearly always a substance seeks that substance because he experiences some type of displeasure usually from chemical influences when he is without it this distinction is of course a valid one but in the end it all boils down to the common currency of pleasure and displeasure and we can use our tools for controlling motivation to battle both we ve already seen john apply our methods to the starting aspect of his undesired activity by making it physically harder for himself to begin the act of smoking he did just about everything he could to make the task of obtaining a cigarette as difficult as possible but while this was certainly a commendable attempt it proved to be insufficient so where did john lack motivation it wasn t in the effort necessary to begin smoking since he dealt with that his consequence motivation didn t seem to be lacking either since it prevented him from smoking for as long as he did the actual act of smoking was certainly very alluring for him in the pleasure it promised to give and the displeasure it promised to relieve but the effort needed to start it and the thoughts of its negative consequences seemed to keep the impulse at bay john s attempt to quit fell apart when the displeasure from not smoking and his desire to smoke prevented him from doing his work adding very substantial negative consequences to not smoking this tipped the scales and john finally succumbed the first and rather obvious step in improving john s situation then is removing those negative consequences of sticking with his resolution to quit we would advise him to take some time off of work and devote that time to leisure so that his struggle against smoking will not distract him from anything important this should accomplish reducing john s problem to merely that of refraining from a powerful impulse to seek pleasure in smoking and reduce displeasure from lack of nicotine without having to deal with other problems besides but even then there is still the risk that that impulse will grow too strong and john won t be able to resist it despite all the effort he must exert to gratify it and all the detrimental consequences that will come of it there is of course room to make obtaining a cigarette even more difficult and increase the consequences of smoking even further but this will likely have sharply diminishing benefits probably the best thing that can be done is to put john in an environment completely devoid of cigarettes where obtaining one would be physically impossible but something like that is usually unfeasible excluding that option the second best approach is to have john engage in some other activities that bring pleasure john s urge to smoke consists of a want for pleasure which can be satisfied by various means and a desire to reduce the displeasure from his lack of nicotine which can be satisfied only by cigarettes or some other source of the chemical the first part of his compulsion to smoke can be satiated by replacing the act of smoking with something else that brings pleasure listening to music or going for a hike or a swim or drinking a smoothie or watching tv or even ingesting some other chemical like caffeine 61 primarily this will serve to allay his want for pleasure from his usual source the cigarette but it will also have the peripheral benefit of soothing the second part of john s compulsion the displeasure by making his current activity more pleasurable and thus the prospective activity of smoking relatively less so just as a mother s caress makes a sick child feel better because it is pleasurable and takes his attention away from the pain of his sickness so will doing something pleasurable cushion the displeasure john feels from an absence of nicotine and make his compulsion to relieve it by smoking much less feverishly desired than if it was the sole thing he was experiencing if john does not want to take a replacement nicotine substance like gum or the patch we have no additional advice left to give him he can do nothing to relieve his displeasure and must instead bear it withholding all the while from his urges to smoke and if he adheres to our advice and succeeds in resisting it the displeasure will soon lessen and eventually fade away altogether 62 it is important to realize that it is precisely because the urge to smoke does lessen with time if it is not indulged that makes quitting an attainable possibility if it instead grew stronger with time when neglected such as the sexual urge all attempts to banish it would be fruitless and a great deal of effort would need to be spent merely to resist it 63 the urge for a cigarette however most certainly does come back and specifically as the result of having one many former smokers who haven t had a cigarette or even wanted one for months or years find their former cravings return with full force and themselves relapsing into addiction after inadvertently smoking only a single cigarette the solution of course is after having quit smoking to stick with it and to avoid having another cigarette ever if one wants to avoid a relapse this can like everything else be accomplished using the motivational techniques listed above the most potent of which is to make obtaining a cigarette as difficult for oneself as possible which means never buying a pack and certainly never having any at hand to smoke when one wishes the video gamer junseo the video gamer is completely entranced by his videogame and is hardly able to do anything else other than play it we may say that he exhibits a quintessential psychological addiction to the game since it is the compulsion to seek pleasure that draws him to it except for the fact that this addiction lasts for only six days but then the only reason junseo was able to quit the game after only six days was that in those six days he managed to finish the game after that the game ceased to hold the same excitement for him since it no longer provided any goals to reach or any promise for future novel gameplay with what we now know about motivation we can confidently predict that if junseo s game took twelve days or even thirty days to beat instead of six then that would be how long he would consequently play it and how long his addiction to it would last 64 if the game could continue indefinitely without a set end or if there was a multitude of similarly exciting games easily available for junseo to play after he beat this one it s quite possible that his addiction to this game or to games in general would continue indefinitely as well 65 in any case we cannot help but consider it very peculiar that simply being exposed for a short time to a videogame is enough for junseo to contract a powerful psychological addiction to it even if only for six days but we must now recognize how superficial the term addiction especially psychological addiction really is after all the roots of junseo s temporary addiction are entirely known to us it is rooted in the ubiquitous need for pleasure biologically imbued in all persons in fact we can justly say that all human beings are by their nature addicts addicts to pleasure it is only when that pleasure is predominantly acquired from a single unhealthy source as junseo s is from videogames that we conventionally label it an addiction junseo s motivational problem is clearly that playing the game for him is simply too damn enjoyable we have already mentioned earlier in this book the way a videogame addiction like this can be overcome by storing the game several miles away committing the person to go through great efforts to start playing it this is perfectly valid in junseo s case too and doing something like that is almost certainly the best alternative he has for quitting it of course junseo does eventually quit the game because he beats it that is another effective way to quit an addictive videogame only it requires the greatest amount of wasted time and effort before it s achieved i only want to add one additional technique that can be implemented in this situation it is to delete the saved file and start the game anew after already completing a good portion of it maybe a quarter of it maybe half maybe 75 then the prospect of playing the game no longer becomes a purely pleasurable one since getting to the exciting novel parts of the game the ones that have not been reached yet now requires replaying the earlier parts that are no longer new or interesting the dread of the boring rote repetition of the first parts of the game which may take hours or days to get through is likely to be enough to overpower the excitement and novelty promised by the later parts additionally the knowledge of having deliberately deleted the game file in order to prevent himself from playing it will have plenty of opportunity to rouse a feeling of shame and or guilt in the person also deterring him from the game or causing him to quit in the middle of it if he does succumb and decides to start it anew it is also important to note that completing a game often leads people to seek pleasure in another similar game after all their impulse to seek pleasure is still there only now this particular game provides no prospect of satisfying it the result is that this played out game will no longer occupy the person s mind and all his motivation for seeking a similar type of enjoyment becomes free for finding other games that provide the same satisfaction and since the motivation for acquiring that pleasure is powerful because that first game was so enjoyable he will be willing to invest a massive amount of effort to find a replacement and very likely succeed in doing so if that first game is abridged halfway however the motivational landscape will be quite different 66 that first game will still occupy the person s mind as a way to satisfy his yearning for enjoyment but he will be held back from it by the aforementioned disincentives then the prospects of finding a new game and restarting the old one will compel the person more or less equally 67 and he will be much more likely to choose neither in this way constraining himself to start a partially completed game all over again if he wants to play it effectively inoculates the person against such games altogether storing the game where it cannot be easily reached will also have the same effect both after all provide a very similar impediment to playing the game in each case the person must do something time consuming effortful and boring in order to resume playing the game from where it is interesting for him those are the best most effective techniques for dealing with this kind of situation but peripheral sources of motivation are as always a helpful supplement to one s primary efforts the sleeper we finally arrive at our last example tom the sleeper tom s case differs from the preceding ones in that rather than battling against a strong compulsion toward a peculiar behavior while trying to do its opposite he is imperceptibly eased by motivational forces in his environment to default in excess to one of the most basic biological functions sleep to be able to understand tom s case we must first abandon the primitive notion that a person s sleep is determined by a psychologically independent biological clock which is set to somewhere between seven and eight hours each day and anybody who consistently sleeps longer or shorter than that must be afflicted with some kind of psychological or biological malady sleep is a behavior like any other and it is subject to all the same principles of motivation and of the pleasure unconscious after all is sleep not pleasurable does it not relieve tiredness which is displeasurable sleep is pleasurable even without the aspect of tiredness but let s first examine the psychology of tiredness to see whether that might be responsible for tom s excessive sleeping 68 what most people don t realize is that the feeling of tiredness isn t just the result of staying awake for a full day rather it is a very distinct psychological phenomenon set off by a very specific psychological trigger and that trigger is forcing oneself to pay attention to something that is entirely boring unpleasurable or monotonous as we already know the pleasure unconscious will strive to pull your attention away from precisely such things but you ll often have some other source of motivation usually consequence motivation that keeps your attention fixed on it it is this internal struggle to focus your attention on something that repels it that is to willfully bear boredom without seeking escape into something pleasurable that will naturally produce the sensation of tiredness let s say you are reading a book which has just entered a boring stretch but you force yourself to keep reading in order to get to another exciting part well this is going to make you extremely tired let s say you are at a lecture and the professor is droning on languidly but you make yourself listen anyway because that material will be on the test you will likely fall asleep in your seat i have often observed as much as half of a fully packed and well rested auditorium fall dead asleep at an especially boring lecture or let s say you are inside a hypnotist s office watching his gold pocket watch swing monotonously in front of your face but you can t look away or else this intimidating man will scold you for taking your eyes off of it you will precisely as he intended grow incredibly tired by the same effect on a recent whale watching cruise i went on i witnessed nearly the whole boat of sixty well rested tourists completely asleep after an hour or so of staring intently at the monotonously swaying ocean waiting to see a small humpback whale that surfaced every five or ten minutes it is this little recognized facet of the human mind that hypnotists secretly make use of by giving a hollow substance less speech in a slow monotonous voice by getting people to focus on the rhythmical movement or the complete stillness of an inanimate object or by making them perform some mindless tedious task like counting all the way down from fifty to induce an intense tiredness and this very same thing may be responsible for tom s oversleeping if a central part of tom s daily routine is making him tired in the above manner it is virtually guaranteed he ll be sleeping more than he should a likely candidate for this is tom s job as we already know the enjoyment a person receives from an activity greatly depends on his ability to engage in it and when his attention capacity decreases over the course of a day for any reason so will his ability to engage in a mentally demanding task given that tom works from home at his computer he could very well be forcing himself to continue working even after his attention capacity can no longer handle it and the process becomes boring and intractable this will surely make him grow very tired and the harder he struggles the more tired he will get there is nothing so psychologically exhausting as trying to successfully carry out an intellectual task which has become at least for the moment too mentally difficult 69 people who hold a nine to five office job it should be noted also experience tiredness under the same conditions but since they have no ready opportunity to fall asleep at their office they naturally find other ways to deal with getting tired at work usually by means of coffee and make it to the end of their workdays in a more or less productive fashion or if they are given a task they must complete by a deadline it is their anxiety that ll motivate them to stay awake tom on the other hand working as he does a mere stone s throw away from his bed and being free to set his own schedule has zero impediments to satisfying his tiredness with sleep and can therefore piece out his work in several hour portions in between catnaps and not even notice the extra time being whittled away by his slumber i personally experienced something like this when i decided one time to do nothing but read les misérables all day every day until i finally finished the book i had to abandon this experiment after two or three days however because i suddenly found myself sleeping almost fourteen hours per diem the book simply couldn t hold my interest for more than several hours at a stretch and when i attempted to carry on past that i was unable to resist the overpowering pull toward slumber if this is the case with tom and his job or if tiredness from some other source is a big driving force of his oversleeping whether that tiredness is caused by his work his leisure or his eating habits and we know overeating is a common cause of tiredness at least in part because it restricts one s attention capacity by diverting blood flow away from the brain we d have to advise tom to begin observing the things that are making him tired and to either stop doing them the moment they become unpleasurable make them more pleasurable by means of the motivational techniques listed above or simply leave his house whenever he begins feeling tired so that he doesn t have the option to return back to his bed 70 but tom s sedentary lifestyle needs not include any of those somniferous factors which essentially hypnotize him to sleep without his knowing it in order to result in him slumbering eleven hours a day the sheer fact that sleep is pleasurable all on its own without tiredness having to play a part is more than enough to cause tom to overindulge in it that is as a way to obtain pleasure as opposed to relieve displeasure and in the absence of any significant sources of tiredness we can assume this to be tom s main motivation for defaulting to it so frequently from just one look at tom s motivational landscape we can see what conditions would coax him to favor sleep over just about all other pleasurable activities the biggest problem tom undeniably has is that sleep is just too easily accessible for him in the whole time he spends in his apartment which seems to be the lion s share of each day his bed stands right alongside him and he constantly has the option to quit whatever he s doing and bury himself in it instead and doing so requires virtually no effort on tom s part which means it s an activity completely devoid of activation energy so we know that for tom the activity of sleep is pleasurable requires no effort to begin and is almost always available that alone however will not sentence him to engage in it for those three extra hours each day indeed there is a substantial amount of people who live in the same conditions and do not fall into this same behavior the difference lies assuming that tiredness isn t the main culprit in tom s consequence motivation that is the one motivational aspect of the activity of sleep in tom s case that we ve yet to consider and we can quickly see that it too rules in the favor of sleep rather than against it first off we know that even after accounting for tom s extra hours of sleep he still has plenty of time to meet all his obligations engage in miscellaneous leisure and have a fair amount of idle time remaining thus there are no physical consequences for tom s superfluous sleep nothing that will crash down upon him or hurt him for it nothing to cause him anxiety that would prevent him from sleeping or wrench him out of his bed tom may feel a tinge of shame for killing that extra time sleeping after all he does consciously disapprove of the situation but that clearly doesn t provide enough negative affect to overcome the physical pleasure that sleep brings him the only significant consequence motivation tom has against sleeping is its opportunity cost the things he could be investing his time in instead of sleep it does not seem that tom has many activities that he is passionate or excited about and that he values a lot more highly than sleep but even if he did there is the unavoidable fact that all such activities would require a significantly greater amount of effort or activation energy than retiring to his bed engaging in them would require traveling leaving the house exerting some other miscellaneous effort while plopping into bed will continue to require only that and be in at least that respect the more attractive alternative for that reason as long as sleep remains the easiest pleasurable activity tom has available to him it will continue to have a powerful foothold in his life so how would we remedy this situation we want tom to choose sleep less often and to wake up from it sooner when he does well our first option is to make the physical process of sleep less pleasurable like by replacing tom s mattress with a thin matt on the bare floor or replacing his sheets with coarse tickling or malodorous ones or substituting his pillows with harder smaller less comfortable ones or maybe doing away with his pillows altogether although this could work in extreme cases its drawbacks can easily outweigh its benefits a less comfortable bed might cause tom to get a less restful night s sleep which might actually result in his sleeping more rather than less in fact not getting a restful enough sleep whether for physical mental or biological reasons may very well be the cause of tom s oversleeping in the first place our second option is making the preliminary act of getting in bed require more effort we can for example advise tom to fill his bed with clutter so he must invest the time to clean it off before lying down or we can advise him to place his bed on a top bunk so he would have to climb to get in it but filling his bed with clutter every morning would itself require effort and if we make climbing into his bed more difficult it would also make it more difficult for him to climb out no our best solution here is making a drastic change to tom s living situation rather than getting tom to spend less time specifically in his bed we can achieve the same results if we more generally get tom to spend less time in his apartment the fundamental method however remains the same to render tom s house less pleasurable to be in one gargantuan problem tom has is that a lot of the pleasures he seeks other than sleep are to be found in his bed as well we ve already noted that he spends much of his leisure hours reading and watching tv in his bed the dreadful effect is that these activities segue directly into sleep since when he becomes bored of them sleep is the easiest most available and most pleasurable option he has removing such pleasures from tom s house should then cause him to seek his enjoyment elsewhere and thus not allow him to default to his bed quite so easily the less amenable tom s apartment is to satisfying his pleasure unconscious the more likely he will be to spend his time outside it 71 once we successfully get rid of tom s tv his books or at least the lighting he has for reading them as well as whatever other easily available pleasures there are in his house the solitary activity of sleep will cease being such an attractive prospect for him since in the absence of all those other pleasurable activities easing him into it the pleasure it s able to bring him is really quite miniscule his sleeping will then be placed in opposition to those highly pleasurable activities and he ll be forced to choose between them and it as opposed to the two dovetailing into each other whether or not this is enough to get tom out of his house however a great piece of advice we can give him under any circumstances is to not work where he sleeps even if tom doesn t have to leaving his apartment to work from some office or library would serve him well in keeping him away from his bed for a large chunk of the day it would be better still if that office was a substantial distance from where he lives making it too daunting a proposition to return home for a quick nap taking on other obligations that get him out of the house would have a similar effect signing up for some kind of class for example and paying in advance so that he doesn t have the option to bow out would certainly work well in achieving this it may also prove helpful if tom moves out of his apartment altogether and into different living quarters preferably with roommates or a girlfriend this would have the double benefit of making his behavior subject to the scrutiny of others and providing him with a readily available source of people which he can spend enjoyable time with outside of his bed even if still in his home with that we may be sure of having given tom the best advice we could and can now close the book on his case and round out this chapter 72 conclusion i hope that having finished this book the reader has gained a valuable understanding of the motivational forces at play in his or her own life and will be able in the future to apply the methods we detailed here and the advice we gave to our five subjects to his or her own situation but these methods are of course only bandages crutches in the areas of our lives where we lack intense passion that extends far beyond the act itself and into a truly important and passion filled aspect of our lives 73 we must always seek to find our calling in life something that fills us with passion and excitement nothing can rival the motivation a person derives from something that he both enjoys and profits from and the greatest times are the ones in which our goals and motivations seamlessly align when we are effortlessly propelled forward and can do no wrong but such things are hard to find and even upon finding them it is inevitable that they too will yield their own problems and moments of demotivation even the hungriest most driven and motivated man will find areas and times in his life where his motivation is insufficient or absent and where he can derive great benefit from our methods it is best to follow our passions to find the things that we love and never stop pursuing them but life will always have its snags and its hurdles and what we cannot reach flying we must reach limping ',\n",
       " 'drive the surrising truth about what motivates us by daniel h pink introduction i n the middle of the last century two young scientists conducted experiments that should have changed the world but did not harry f harlow was a professor of psychology at the university of wisconsin who in the 1940s established one of the world s first laboratories for studying primate behavior one day in 1949 harlow and two colleagues gathered eight rhesus monkeys for a two week experiment on learning the researchers devised a simple mechanical puzzle like the one pictured on the next page solving it required three steps pull out the vertical pin undo the hook and lift the hinged cover pretty easy for you and me far more challenging for a thirteen pound lab monkey harlow s puzzle in the starting left and solved right positions the experimenters placed the puzzles in the monkeys cages to observe how they reacted and to prepare them for tests of their problem solving prowess at the end of the two weeks but almost immediately something strange happened unbidden by any outside urging and unprompted by the experimenters the monkeys began playing with the puzzles with focus determination and what looked like enjoyment and in short order they began figuring out how the contraptions worked by the time harlow tested the monkeys on days 13 and 14 of the experiment the primates had become quite adept they solved the puzzles frequently and quickly two thirds of the time they cracked the code in less than sixty seconds now this was a bit odd nobody had taught the monkeys how to remove the pin slide the hook and open the cover nobody had rewarded them with food affection or even quiet applause when they succeeded and that ran counter to the accepted notions of how primates including the bigger brained less hairy primates known as human beings behaved scientists then knew that two main drives powered behavior the first was the biological drive humans and other animals ate to sate their hunger drank to quench their thirst and copulated to satisfy their carnal urges but that wasn t happening here solution did not lead to food water or sex gratification harlow reported but the only other known drive also failed to explain the monkeys peculiar behavior if biological motivations came from within this second drive came from without the rewards and punishments the environment delivered for behaving in certain ways this was certainly true for humans who responded exquisitely to such external forces if you promised to raise our pay we d work harder if you held out the prospect of getting an a on the test we d study longer if you threatened to dock us for showing up late or for incorrectly completing a form we d arrive on time and tick every box but that didn t account for the monkeys actions either as harlow wrote and you can almost hear him scratching his head the behavior obtained in this investigation poses some interesting questions for motivation theory since significant learning was attained and efficient performance maintained without resort to special or extrinsic incentives what else could it be to answer the question harlow offered a novel theory what amounted to a third drive the performance of the task he said provided intrinsic reward the monkeys solved the puzzles simply because they found it gratifying to solve puzzles they enjoyed it the joy of the task was its own reward if this notion was radical what happened next only deepened the confusion and controversy perhaps this newly discovered drive harlow eventually called it intrinsic motivation was real but surely it was subordinate to the other two drives if the monkeys were rewarded with raisins for solving the puzzles they d no doubt perform even better yet when harlow tested that approach the monkeys actually made more errors and solved the puzzles less frequently introduction of food in the present experiment harlow wrote served to disrupt performance a phenomenon not reported in the literature now this was really odd in scientific terms it was akin to rolling a steel ball down an inclined plane to measure its velocity only to watch the ball float into the air instead it suggested that our understanding of the gravitational pulls on our behavior was inadequate that what we thought were fixed laws had plenty of loopholes harlow emphasized the strength and persistence of the monkeys drive to complete the puzzles then he noted it would appear that this drive may be as basic and strong as the other drives furthermore there is some reason to believe that it can be as efficient in facilitating learning at the time however the prevailing two drives held a tight grip on scientific thinking so harlow sounded the alarm he urged scientists to close down large sections of our theoretical junkyard and offer fresher more accurate accounts of human behavior he warned that our explanation of why we did what we did was incomplete he said that to truly understand the human condition we had to take account of this third drive then he pretty much dropped the whole idea rather than battle the establishment and begin offering a more complete view of motivation harlow abandoned this contentious line of research and later became famous for studies on the science of affection his notion of this third drive bounced around the psychological literature but it remained on the periphery of behavioral science and of our understanding of ourselves it would be two decades before another scientist picked up the thread that harlow had so provocatively left on that wisconsin laboratory table in the summer of 1969 edward deci was a carnegie mellon university psychology graduate student in search of a dissertation topic deci who had already earned an mba from wharton was intrigued by motivation but suspected that scholars and businesspeople had misunderstood it so tearing a page from the harlow playbook he set out to study the topic with the help of a puzzle deci chose the soma puzzle cube a then popular parker brothers offering that thanks to youtube retains something of a cult following today the puzzle shown below consists of seven plastic pieces six comprising four one inch cubes one comprising three one inch cubes players can assemble the seven pieces into a few million possible combinations from abstract shapes to recognizable objects the seven pieces of the soma puzzle unassembled left and then fashioned into one of several million possible configurations for the study deci divided participants male and female university students into an experimental group what i ll call group a and a control group what i ll call group b each participated in three one hour sessions held on consecutive days here s how the sessions worked each participant entered a room and sat at a table on top of which were the seven soma puzzle pieces drawings of three puzzle configurations and copies of time the new yorker and playboy hey it was 1969 deci sat on the opposite end of the table to explain the instructions and to time performance with a stopwatch in the first session members of both groups had to assemble the soma pieces to replicate the configurations before them in the second session they did the same thing with different drawings only this time deci told group a that they d be paid 1 the equivalent of nearly 6 today for every configuration they successfully reproduced group b meanwhile got new drawings but no pay finally in the third session both groups received new drawings and had to reproduce them for no compensation just as in session one see the table below how the two groups were treated the twist came midway through each session after a participant had assembled the soma puzzle pieces to match two of the three drawings deci halted the proceedings he said that he was going to give them a fourth drawing but to choose the right one he needed to feed their completion times into a computer and this being the late 1960s when room straddling mainframes were the norm and desktop pcs were still a decade away that meant he had to leave for a little while on the way out he said i shall be gone only a few minutes you may do whatever you like while i m gone but deci wasn t really plugging numbers into an ancient teletype instead he walked to an adjoining room connected to the experiment room by a one way window then for exactly eight minutes he watched what people did when left alone did they continue fiddling with the puzzle perhaps attempting to reproduce the third drawing or did they do something else page through the magazines check out the centerfold stare into space catch a quick nap in the first session not surprisingly there wasn t much difference between what the group a and group b participants did during that secretly watched eight minute free choice period both continued playing with the puzzle on average for between three and a half and four minutes suggesting they found it at least somewhat interesting on the second day during which group a participants were paid for each successful configuration and group b participants were not the unpaid group behaved mostly as they had during the first free choice period but the paid group suddenly got really interested in soma puzzles on average the people in group a spent more than five minutes messing with the puzzle perhaps getting a head start on that third challenge or gearing up for the chance to earn some beer money when deci returned this makes intuitive sense right it s consistent with what we believe about motivation reward me and i ll work harder yet what happened on the third day confirmed deci s own suspicions about the peculiar workings of motivation and gently called into question a guiding premise of modern life this time deci told the participants in group a that there was only enough money to pay them for one day and that this third session would therefore be unpaid then things unfolded just as before two puzzles followed by deci s interruption during the ensuing eight minute free choice period the subjects in the never been paid group b actually played with the puzzle for a little longer than they had in previous sessions maybe they were becoming ever more engaged maybe it was just a statistical quirk but the subjects in group a who previously had been paid responded differently they now spent significantly less time playing with the puzzle not only about two minutes less than during their paid session but about a full minute less than in the first session when they initially encountered and obviously enjoyed the puzzles in an echo of what harlow discovered two decades earlier deci revealed that human motivation seemed to operate by laws that ran counter to what most scientists and citizens believed from the office to the playing field we knew what got people going rewards especially cold hard cash intensified interest and enhanced performance what deci found and then confirmed in two additional studies he conducted shortly thereafter was almost the opposite when money is used as an external reward for some activity the subjects lose intrinsic interest for the activity he wrote rewards can deliver a short term boost just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cranking for a few more hours but the effect wears off and worse can reduce a person s longer term motivation to continue the project human beings deci said have an inherent tendency to seek out novelty and challenges to extend and exercise their capacities to explore and to learn but this third drive was more fragile than the other two it needed the right environment to survive one who is interested in developing and enhancing intrinsic motivation in children employees students etc should not concentrate on external control systems such as monetary rewards he wrote in a f ollow up paper thus began what for deci became a lifelong quest to rethink why we do what we do a pursuit that sometimes put him at odds with fellow psychologists got him fired from a business school and challenged the operating assumptions of organizations everywhere it was controversial deci told me one spring morning forty years after the soma experiments nobody was expecting rewards would have a negative effect this is a book about motivation i will show that much of what we believe about the subject just isn t so and that the insights that harlow and deci began uncovering a few decades ago come much closer to the truth the problem is that most businesses haven t caught up to this new understanding of what motivates us too many organizations not just companies but governments and nonprofits as well still operate from assumptions about human potential and individual performance that are outdated unexamined and rooted more in folklore than in science they continue to pursue practices such as short term incentive plans and pay for performance schemes in the face of mounting evidence that such measures usually don t work and often do harm worse these practices have infiltrated our schools where we ply our future workforce with ipods cash and pizza coupons to incentivize them to learn something has gone wrong the good news is that the solution stands before us in the work of a band of behavioral scientists who have carried on the pioneering efforts of harlow and deci and whose quiet work over the last half century offers us a more dynamic view of human motivation for too long there s been a mismatch between what science knows and what business does the goal of this book is to repair that breach drive has three parts part one will look at the flaws in our reward and punishment system and propose a new way to think about motivation chapter 1 will examine how the prevailing view of motivation is becoming incompatible with many aspects of contemporary business and life chapter 2 will reveal the seven reasons why carrot and stick extrinsic motivators often produce the opposite of what they set out to achieve following that is a short addendum chapter 2a that shows the special circumstances when carrots and sticks actually can be effective chapter 3 will introduce what i call type i behavior a way of thinking and an approach to business grounded in the real science of human motivation and powered by our third drive our innate need to direct our own lives to learn and create new things and to do better by ourselves and our world part two will examine the three elements of type i behavior and show how individuals and organizations are using them to improve performance and deepen satisfaction chapter 4 will explore autonomy our desire to be self directed chapter 5 will look at mastery our urge to get better and better at what we do chapter 6 will explore purpose our yearning to be part of something larger than ourselves part three the type i toolkit is a comprehensive set of resources to help you create settings in which type i behavior can flourish here you ll find everything from dozens of exercises to awaken motivation in yourself and others to discussion questions for your book club to a supershort summary of drive that will help you fake your way through a cocktail party and while this book is mostly about business in this section i ll offer some thoughts about how to apply these concepts to education and to our lives outside of work but before we get down to all that let s begin with a thought experiment one that requires going back in time to the days when john major was britain s prime minister barack obama was a skinny young law professor internet connections were dial up and a blackberry was still just a fruit drive part one a new operating system drive chapter 1 the rise and fall of motivation 2 0 i magine it s 1995 you sit down with an economist an accomplished business school professor with a ph d in economics you say to her i ve got a crystal ball here that can peer fifteen years into the future i d like to test your forecasting powers she s skeptical but she decides to humor you i m going to describe two new encyclopedias one just out the other to be launched in a few years you have to predict which will be more successful in 2010 bring it she says the first encyclopedia comes from microsoft as you know microsoft is already a large and profitable company and with this year s introduction of windows 95 it s about to become an era defining colossus microsoft will fund this encyclopedia it will pay professional writers and editors to craft articles on thousands of topics well compensated managers will oversee the project to ensure it s completed on budget and on time then microsoft will sell the encyclopedia on cd roms and later online the second encyclopedia won t come from a company it will be created by tens of thousands of people who write and edit articles for fun these hobbyists won t need any special qualifications to participate and nobody will be paid a dollar or a euro or a yen to write or edit articles participants will have to contribute their labor sometimes twenty and thirty hours per week for free the encyclopedia itself which will exist online will also be free no charge for anyone who wants to use it now you say to the economist think forward fifteen years according to my crystal ball in 2010 one of these encyclopedias will be the largest and most popular in the world and the other will be defunct which is which in 1995 i doubt you could have a found a single sober economist anywhere on planet earth who would not have picked that first model as the success any other conclusion would have been laughable contrary to nearly every business principle she taught her students it would have been like asking a zoologist who would win a 200 meter footrace between a cheetah and your brother in law not even close sure that ragtag band of volunteers might produce something but there was no way its product could compete with an offering from a powerful profit driven company the incentives were all wrong microsoft stood to gain from the success of its product everyone involved in the other project knew from the outset that success would earn them nothing most important microsoft s writers editors and managers were paid the other project s contributors were not in fact it probably cost them money each time they performed free work instead of remunerative labor the question was such a no brainer that our economist wouldn t even have considered putting it on an exam for her mba class it was too easy but you know how things turned out on october 31 2009 microsoft pulled the plug on msn encarta its disc and online encyclopedia which had been on the market for sixteen years meanwhile wikipedia that second model ended up becoming the largest and most popular encyclopedia in the world just eight years after its inception wikipedia had more than 13 million articles in some 260 languages including 3 million in english alone what happened the conventional view of human motivation has a very hard time explaining this result the triumph of carrots and sticks c omputers whether the giant mainframes in deci s experiments the imac on which i m writing this sentence or the mobile phone chirping in your pocket all have operating systems beneath the surface of the hardware you touch and the programs you manipulate is a complex layer of software that contains the instructions protocols and suppositions that enable everything to function smoothly most of us don t think much about operating systems we notice them only when they start failing when the hardware and software they re supposed to manage grow too large and complicated for the current operating system to handle then our computer starts crashing we complain and smart software developers who ve always been tinkering with pieces of the program sit down to write a fundamentally better one an upgrade societies also have operating systems the laws social customs and economic arrangements that we encounter each day sit atop a layer of instructions protocols and suppositions about how the world works and much of our societal operating system consists of a set of assumptions about human behavior in our very early days i mean very early days say fifty thousand years ago the underlying assumption about human behavior was simple and true we were trying to survive from roaming the savannah to gather food to scrambling for the bushes when a saber toothed tiger approached that drive guided most of our behavior call this early operating system motivation 1 0 it wasn t especially elegant nor was it much different from those of rhesus monkeys giant apes or many other animals but it served us nicely it worked well until it didn t as humans formed more complex societies bumping up against strangers and needing to cooperate in order to get things done an operating system based purely on the biological drive was inadequate in fact sometimes we needed ways to restrain this drive to prevent me from swiping your dinner and you from stealing my spouse and so in a feat of remarkable cultural engineering we slowly replaced what we had with a version more compatible with how we d begun working and living at the core of this new and improved operating system was a revised and more accurate assumption humans are more than the sum of our biological urges that first drive still mattered no doubt about that but it didn t fully account for who we are we also had a second drive to seek reward and avoid punishment more broadly and it was from this insight that a new operating system call it motivation 2 0 arose of course other animals also respond to rewards and punishments but only humans have proved able to channel this drive to develop everything from contract law to convenience stores harnessing this second drive has been essential to economic progress around the world especially during the last two centuries consider the industrial revolution technological developments steam engines railroads widespread electricity played a crucial role in fostering the growth of industry but so did less tangible innovations in particular the work of an american engineer named frederick winslow taylor in the early 1900s taylor who believed businesses were being run in an inefficient haphazard way invented what he called scientific management his invention was a form of software expertly crafted to run atop the motivation 2 0 platform and it was widely and quickly adopted workers this approach held were like parts in a complicated machine if they did the right work in the right way at the right time the machine would function smoothly and to ensure that happened you simply rewarded the behavior you sought and punished the behavior you discouraged people would respond rationally to these external forces these extrinsic motivators and both they and the system itself would flourish we tend to think that coal and oil have powered economic development but in some sense the engine of commerce has been fueled equally by carrots and sticks the motivation 2 0 operating system has endured for a very long time indeed it is so deeply embedded in our lives that most of us scarcely recognize that it exists for as long as any of us can remember we ve configured our organizations and constructed our lives around its bedrock assumption the way to improve performance increase productivity and encourage excellence is to reward the good and punish the bad despite its greater sophistication and higher aspirations motivation 2 0 still wasn t exactly ennobling it suggested that in the end human beings aren t much different from horses that the way to get us moving in the right direction is by dangling a crunchier carrot or wielding a sharper stick but what this operating system lacked in enlightenment it made up for in effectiveness it worked well extremely well until it didn t as the twentieth century progressed as economies grew still more complex and as the people in them had to deploy new more sophisticated skills the motivation 2 0 approach encountered some resistance in the 1950s abraham maslow a former student of harry harlow s at the university of wisconsin developed the field of humanistic psychology which questioned the idea that human behavior was purely the ratlike seeking of positive stimuli and avoidance of negative stimuli in 1960 mit management professor douglas mcgregor imported some of maslow s ideas to the business world mcgregor challenged the presumption that humans are fundamentally inert that absent external rewards and punishments we wouldn t do much people have other higher drives he said and these drives could benefit businesses if managers and business leaders respected them thanks in part to mcgregor s writing companies evolved a bit dress codes relaxed schedules became more flexible many organizations looked for ways to grant employees greater autonomy and to help them grow these refinements repaired some weaknesses but they amounted to a modest improvement rather than a thorough upgrade motivation 2 1 and so this general approach remained intact because it was after all easy to understand simple to monitor and straightforward to enforce but in the first ten years of this century a period of truly staggering underachievement in business technology and social progress we ve discovered that this sturdy old operating system doesn t work nearly as well it crashes often and unpredictably it forces people to devise workarounds to bypass its flaws most of all it is proving incompatible with many aspects of contemporary business and if we examine those incompatibility problems closely we ll realize that modest updates a patch here or there will not solve the problem what we need is a full scale upgrade three incompatibility problems m otivation 2 0 still serves some purposes well it s just deeply unreliable sometimes it works many times it doesn t and understanding its defects will help determine which parts to keep and which to discard as we fashion an upgrade the glitches fall into three broad categories our current operating system has become far less compatible with and at times downright antagonistic to how we organize what we do how we think about what we do and how we do what we do how we organize what we do go back to that encyclopedic showdown between microsoft and wikipedia the assumptions at the heart of motivation 2 0 suggest that such a result shouldn t even be possible wikipedia s triumph seems to defy the laws of behavioral physics now if this all volunteer all amateur encyclopedia were the only instance of its kind we might dismiss it as an aberration an exception that proves the rule but it s not instead wikipedia

drinks won t suffice open source beer this new way of organizing what we do doesn t banish extrinsic rewards people in the open source movement haven t taken vows of poverty for many participation in these projects can burnish their reputations and sharpen their skills which can enhance their earning power entrepreneurs have launched new and sometimes lucrative companies to help organizations implement and maintain open source software applications but ultimately open source depends on intrinsic motivation with the same ferocity that older business models rely on extrinsic motivation as several scholars have shown mit management professor karim lakhani and boston consulting group consultant bob wolf surveyed 684 open source developers mostly in north america and europe about why they participated in these projects lakhani and wolf uncovered a range of motives but they found that enjoyment based intrinsic motivation namely how creative a person feels when working on the project is the strongest and most pervasive driver a large majority of programmers the researchers discovered reported that they frequently reached the state of optimal challenge called flow likewise three german economists who studied open source projects around the world found that what drives participants is a set of predominantly intrinsic motives in particular the fun of mastering the challenge of a given software problem and the desire to give a gift to the programmer community motivation 2 0 has little room for these sorts of impulses what s more open source is only one way people are restructuring what they do along new organizational lines and atop different motivational ground let s move from software code to the legal code the laws in most developed countries permit essentially two types of business organizations profit and nonprofit one makes money the other does good and the most prominent member of that first category is the publicly held corporation owned by shareholders and run by managers who are overseen by a board of directors the managers and directors bear one overriding responsibility to maximize shareholder gain other types of business organizations steer by the same rules of the road in the united states for instance partnerships s corporations c corporations limited liability corporations and other business configurations all aim toward a common end the objective of those who run them practically legally in some ways morally is to maximize profit let me give a rousing heartfelt and grateful cheer for these business forms and the farsighted countries that enable their citizens to create them without them our lives would be infinitely less prosperous less healthy and less happy but in the last few years several people around the world have been changing the recipe and cooking up new varieties of business organizations for example in april 2008 vermont became the first u s state to allow a new type of business called the low profit limited liability corporation dubbed an l3c this entity is a corporation but not as we typically think of it as one report explained an l3c operate s like a for profit business generating at least modest profits but its primary aim is to offer significant social benefits three other u s states have followed vermont s lead an l3c in north carolina for instance is buying abandoned furniture factories in the state updating them with green technology and leasing them back to beleaguered furniture manufacturers at a low rate the venture hopes to make money but its real purpose is to help revitalize a struggling region meanwhile nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus has begun creating what he calls social businesses these are companies that raise capital develop products and sell them in an open market but do so in the service of a larger social mission or as he puts it with the profit maximization principle replaced by the social benefit principle the fourth sector network in the united states and denmark is promoting the for benefit organization a hybrid that it says represents a new category of organization that is both economically self sustaining and animated by a public purpose one example mozilla the entity that gave us firefox is organized as a for benefit organization and three u s entrepreneurs have invented the b corporation a designation that requires companies to amend their bylaws so that the incentives favor long term value and social impact instead of short term economic gain neither open source production nor previously unimagined not only for profit businesses are yet the norm of course and they won t consign the public corporation to the trash heap but their emergence tells us something important about where we re heading there s a big movement out there that is not yet recognized as a movement a lawyer who specializes in for benefit organizations told the new york times one reason could be that traditional businesses are profit maximizers which square perfectly with motivation 2 0 these new entities are purpose maximizers which are unsuited to this older operating system because they flout its very principles how we think about what we do when i took my first economics course back in the early 1980s our professor a brilliant lecturer with a patton like stage presence offered an important clarification before she d chalked her first indifference curve on the blackboard economics she explained wasn t the study of money it was the study of behavior in the course of a day each of us was constantly figuring the cost and benefits of our actions and then deciding how to act economists studied what people did rather than what we said because we did what was best for us we were rational calculators of our economic self interest when i studied law a few years later a similar idea reappeared the newly ascendant field of law and economics held that precisely because we were such awesome self interest calculators laws and regulations often impeded rather than permitted sensible and just outcomes i survived law school in no small part because i discovered the talismanic phrase and offered it on exams in a world of perfect information and low transaction costs the parties will bargain to a wealth maximizing result then about a decade later came a curious turn of events that made me question much of what i d worked hard and taken on enormous debt to learn in 2002 the nobel foundation awarded its prize in economics to a guy who wasn t even an economist and they gave him the field s highest honor largely for revealing that we weren t always rational calculators of our economic self interest and that the parties often didn t bargain to a wealth maximizing result daniel kahneman an american psychologist who won the nobel prize in economics that year for work he d done with israeli amos tversky helped force a change in how we think about what we do and one of the implications of this new way of thinking is that it calls into question many of the assumptions of motivation 2 0 kahneman and others in the field of behavioral economics agreed with my professor that economics was the study of human economic behavior they just believed that we d placed too much emphasis on the economic and not enough on the human that hyperrational calculator brained person wasn t real he was a convenient fiction play a game with me and i ll try to illustrate the point suppose somebody gives me ten dollars and tells me to share it some all or none with you if you accept my offer we both get to keep the money if you reject it neither of us gets anything if i offered you six dollars keeping four for myself would you take it almost certainly if i offered you five you d probably take that too but what if i offered you two dollars would you take it in an experiment replicated around the world most people rejected offers of two dollars and below that makes no sense in terms of wealth maximization if you take my offer of two dollars you re two dollars richer if you reject it you get nothing your cognitive calculator knows two is greater than zero but because you re a human being your notions of fair play or your desire for revenge or your simple irritation overrides it in real life our behavior is far more complex than the textbook allows and often confounds the idea that we re purely rational we don t save enough for retirement even though it s to our clear economic advantage to do so we hang on to bad investments longer than we should because we feel far sharper pain from losing money than we do from gaining the exact same amount give us a choice of two television sets we ll pick one toss in an irrelevant third choice and we ll pick the other in short we are irrational and predictably so says economist dan ariely author of predictably irrational a book that offers an entertaining and engaging overview of behavioral economics the trouble for our purposes is that motivation 2 0 assumes we re the same robotic wealth maximizers i was taught we were a couple of decades ago indeed the very premise of extrinsic incentives is that we ll always respond rationally to them but even most economists don t believe that anymore sometimes these motivators work often they don t and many times they inflict collateral damage in short the new way economists think about what we do is hard to reconcile with motivation 2 0 what s more if people do things for lunk headed backward looking reasons why wouldn t we also do things for significance seeking self actualizing reasons if we re predictably irrational and we clearly are why couldn t we also be predictably transcendent if that seems far fetched consider some of our other bizarre behaviors we leave lucrative jobs to take low paying ones that provide a clearer sense of purpose we work to master the clarinet on weekends although we have little hope of making a dime motivation 2 0 or acquiring a mate motivation 1 0 from doing so we play with puzzles even when we don t get a few raisins or dollars for solving them some scholars are already widening the reach of behavioral economics to encompass these ideas the most prominent is bruno frey an economist at the university of zurich like the behavioral economists he has argued that we need to move beyond the idea of homo oeconomicus economic man that fictional wealth maximizing robot but his extension goes in a slightly different direction to what he calls homo oeconomicus maturus or mature economic man this figure he says is more ômature in the sense that he is endowed with a more refined motivational structure in other words to fully understand human economic behavior we have to come to terms with an idea at odds with motivation 2 0 as frey writes intrinsic motivation is of great importance for all economic activities it is inconceivable that people are motivated solely or even mainly by external incentives how we do what we do if you manage other people take a quick glance over your shoulder there s a ghost hovering there his name is frederick winslow taylor remember him from earlier in the chapter and he s whispering in your ear work taylor is murmuring consists mainly of simple not particularly interesting tasks the only way to get people to do them is to incentivize them properly and monitor them carefully in the early 1900s taylor had a point today in much of the world that s less true yes for some people work remains routine unchallenging and directed by others but for a surprisingly large number of people jobs have become more complex more interesting and more self directed and that type of work presents a direct challenge to the assumptions of motivation 2 0 begin with complexity behavioral scientists often divide what we do on the job or learn in school into two categories algorithmic and heuristic an algorithmic task is one in which you follow a set of established instructions down a single pathway to one conclusion that is there s an algorithm for solving it a heuristic task is the opposite precisely because no algorithm exists for it you have to experiment with possibilities and devise a novel solution working as a grocery checkout clerk is mostly algorithmic you do pretty much the same thing over and over in a certain way creating an ad campaign is mostly heuristic you have to come up with something new during the twentieth century most work was algorithmic and not just jobs where you turned the same screw the same way all day long even when we traded blue collars for white the tasks we carried out were often routine that is we could reduce much of what we did in accounting law computer programming and other fields to a script a spec sheet a formula or a series of steps that produced a right answer but today in much of north america western europe japan south korea and australia routine white collar work is disappearing it s racing offshore to wherever it can be done the cheapest in india bulgaria the philippines and other countries lower paid workers essentially run the algorithm figure out the correct answer and deliver it instantaneously from their computer to someone six thousand miles away but offshoring is just one pressure on rule based left brain work just as oxen and then forklifts replaced simple physical labor computers are replacing simple intellectual labor so while outsourcing is just beginning to pick up speed software can already perform many rule based professional functions better more quickly and more cheaply than we can that means that your cousin the cpa if he s doing mostly routine work faces competition not just from five hundred dollar a month accountants in manila but from tax preparation programs anyone can download for thirty dollars the consulting firm mckinsey co estimates that in the united states only 30 percent of job growth now comes from algorithmic work while 70 percent comes from heuristic work a key reason routine work can be outsourced or automated artistic empathic nonroutine work generally cannot the implications for motivation are vast researchers such as harvard business school s teresa amabile have found that external rewards and punishments both carrots and sticks can work nicely for algorithmic tasks but they can be devastating for heuristic ones those sorts of challenges solving novel problems or creating something the world didn t know it was missing depend heavily on harlow s third drive amabile calls it the intrinsic motivation principle of creativity which holds in part intrinsic motivation is conducive to creativity controlling extrinsic motivation is detrimental to creativity in other words the central tenets of motivation 2 0 may actually impair performance of the heuristic right brain work on which modern economies depend partly because work has become more creative and less routine it has also become more enjoyable that too scrambles motivation 2 0 s assumptions this operating system rests on the belief that work is not inherently enjoyable which is precisely why we must coax people with external rewards and threaten them with outside punishment one unexpected finding of the psychologist mihaly csikszentmihalyi whom we ll encounter in chapter 5 is that people are much more likely to report having optimal experiences on the job than during leisure but if work is inherently enjoyable for more and more people then the external inducements at the heart of motivation 2 0 become less necessary worse as deci began discovering forty years ago adding certain kinds of extrinsic rewards on top of inherently interesting tasks can often dampen motivation and diminish performance once again certain bedrock notions suddenly seem less sturdy take the curious example of vocation vacations this is a business in which people pay their hard earned money to work at another job they use their vacation time to test drive being a chef running a bike shop or operating an animal shelter the emergence of this and similar ventures suggests that work which economists have always considered a disutility something we d avoid unless we received a payment in return is becoming a utility something we d pursue even in the absence of a tangible return finally because work is supposed to be dreary motivation 2 0 holds that people need to be carefully monitored so they don t shirk this idea too is becoming less relevant and in many ways less possible consider for instance that america alone now has more than 18 million of what the u s census bureau calls non employer businesses businesses without any paid employees since people in these businesses don t have any underlings they don t have anybody to manage or motivate but since they don t have bosses themselves there s nobody to manage or motivate them they have to be self directed so do people who aren t technically working for themselves in the united states 33 7 million people telecommute at least one day a month and 14 7 million do so every day placing a substantial portion of the workforce beyond the gaze of a manager forcing them to direct their own work and even if many organizations haven t opted for measures like these they re generally becoming leaner and less hierarchical in an effort to reduce costs they trim the fatty middle that means managers oversee larger numbers of people and therefore scrutinize each one less closely as organizations flatten companies need people who are self motivated that forces many organizations to become more like er wikipedia nobody manages the wikipedians nobody sits around trying to figure out how to motivate them that s why wikipedia works routine not so interesting jobs require direction nonroutine more interesting work depends on self direction one business leader who didn t want to be identified said it plainly when he conducts job interviews he tells prospective employees if you need me to motivate you i probably don t want to hire you to recap motivation 2 0 suffers from three compatibility problems it doesn t mesh with the way many new business models are organizing what we do because we re intrinsically motivated purpose maximizers not only extrinsically motivated profit maximizers it doesn t comport with the way that twenty first century economics thinks about what we do because economists are finally realizing that we re full fledged human beings not single minded economic robots and perhaps most important it s hard to reconcile with much of what we actually do at work because for growing numbers of people work is often creative interesting and self directed rather than unrelentingly routine boring and other directed taken together these compatibility problems warn us that something s gone awry in our motivational operating system but in order to figure out exactly what and as an essential step in fashioning a new one we need to take a look at the bugs themselves drive chapter 2 seven reasons carrots and sticks often don t work a n object in motion will stay in motion and an object at rest will stay at rest unless acted on by an outside force that s newton s first law of motion like newton s other laws this one is elegant and simple which is part of its power even people like me who bumbled though high school physics can understand it and can use it to interpret the world motivation 2 0 is similar at its heart are two elegant and simple ideas rewarding an activity will get you more of it punishing an activity will get you less of it and just as newton s principles can help us explain our physical environment or chart the path of a thrown ball motivation 2 0 s principles can help us comprehend our social surroundings and predict the trajectory of human behavior but newtonian physics runs into problems at the subatomic level down there in the land of hadrons quarks and schršdinger s cat things get freaky the cool rationality of isaac newton gives way to the bizarre unpredictability of lewis carroll motivation 2 0 is similar in this regard too when rewards and punishments encounter our third drive something akin to behavioral quantum mechanics seems to take over and strange things begin to happen of course the starting point for any discussion of motivation in the workplace is a simple fact of life people have to earn a living salary contract payments some benefits a few perks are what i call baseline rewards if someone s baseline rewards aren t adequate or equitable her focus will be on the unfairness of her situation and the anxiety of her circumstance you ll get neither the predictability of extrinsic motivation nor the weirdness of intrinsic motivation you ll get very little motivation at all but once we re past that threshold carrots and sticks can achieve precisely the opposite of their intended aims mechanisms designed to increase motivation can dampen it tactics aimed at boosting creativity can reduce it programs to promote good deeds can make them disappear meanwhile instead of restraining negative behavior rewards and punishments can often set it loose and give rise to cheating addiction and dangerously myopic thinking this is weird and it doesn t hold in all circumstances about which more after this chapter but as edward deci s soma puzzle experiment demonstrates many practices whose effectiveness we take for granted produce counterintuitive results they can give us less of what we want and more of what we don t want these are the bugs in motivation 2 0 and they rise to the surface whether we re promising rupees in india charging shekels in israel drawing blood in sweden or painting portraits in chicago less of what we want o ne of the most enduring scenes in american literature offers an important lesson in human motivation in chapter 2 of mark twain s the adventures of tom sawyer tom faces the dreary task of whitewashing aunt polly s 810 square foot fence he s not exactly thrilled with the assignment life to him seemed hollow and existence but a burden twain writes but just when tom has nearly lost hope nothing less than a great magnificent inspiration bursts upon him when his friend ben ambles by and mocks tom for his sorry lot tom acts confused slapping paint on a fence isn t a grim chore he says it s a fantastic privilege a source of ahem intrinsic motivation the job is so captivating that when ben asks to try a few brushstrokes himself tom refuses he doesn t relent until ben gives up his apple in exchange for the opportunity soon more boys arrive all of whom tumble into tom s trap and end up whitewashing the fence several times over on his behalf from this episode twain extracts a key motivational principle namely that work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do and that play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do he goes on to write there are wealthy gentlemen in england who drive four horse passenger coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line in the summer because the privilege costs them considerable money but if they were offered wages for the service that would turn it into work and then they would resign in other words rewards can perform a weird sort of behavioral alchemy they can transform an interesting task into a drudge they can turn play into work and by diminishing intrinsic motivation they can send performance creativity and even upstanding behavior toppling like dominoes let s call this the sawyer effect a sampling of intriguing experiments around the world reveals the four realms where this effect kicks in and shows yet again the mismatch between what science knows and what business does intrinsic motivation behavioral scientists like deci began discovering the sawyer effect nearly forty years ago although they didn t use that term instead they referred to the counterintuitive consequences of extrinsic incentives as the hidden costs of rewards that in fact was the title of the first book on the subject a 1978 research volume that was edited by psychologists mark lepper and david greene one of lepper and greene s early studies which they carried out with a third colleague robert nisbett has become a classic in the field and among the most cited articles in the motivation literature the three researchers watched a classroom of preschoolers for several days and identified the children who chose to spend their free play time drawing then they fashioned an experiment to test the effect of rewarding an activity these children clearly enjoyed the researchers divided the children into three groups the first was the expected award group they showed each of these children a good player certificate adorned with a blue ribbon and featuring the child s name and asked if the child wanted to draw in order to receive the award the second group was the unexpected award group researchers asked these children simply if they wanted to draw if they decided to when the session ended the researchers handed each child one of the good player certificates the third group was the no award group researchers asked these children if they wanted to draw but neither promised them a certificate at the beginning nor gave them one at the end two weeks later back in the classroom teachers set out paper and markers during the preschool s free play period while the researchers secretly observed the students children previously in the unexpected award and no award groups drew just as much and with the same relish as they had before the experiment but children in the first group the ones who d expected and then received an award showed much less interest and spent much less time drawing the sawyer effect had taken hold even two weeks later those alluring prizes so common in classrooms and cubicles had turned play into work to be clear it wasn t necessarily the rewards themselves that dampened the children s interest remember when children didn t expect a reward receiving one had little impact on their intrinsic motivation only contingent rewards if you do this then you ll get that had the negative effect why if then rewards require people to forfeit some of their autonomy like the gentlemen driving carriages for money instead of fun they re no longer fully controlling their lives and that can spring a hole in the bottom of their motivational bucket draining an activity of its enjoyment lepper and greene replicated these results in several subsequent experiments with children as time went on other researchers found similar results with adults over and over again they discovered that extrinsic rewards in particular contingent expected if then rewards snuffed out the third drive these insights proved so controversial after all they called into question a standard practice of most companies and schools that in 1999 deci and two colleagues reanalyzed nearly three decades of studies on the subject to confirm the findings careful consideration of reward effects reported in 128 experiments lead to the conclusion that tangible rewards tend to have a substantially negative effect on intrinsic motivation they determined when institutions families schools businesses and athletic teams for example focus on the short term and opt for controlling people s behavior they do considerable long term damage try to encourage a kid to learn math by paying her for each work book page she completes and she ll almost certainly become more diligent in the short term and lose interest in math in the long term take an industrial designer who loves his work and try to get him to do better by making his pay contingent on a hit product and he ll almost certainly work like a maniac in the short term but become less interested in his job in the long term as one leading behavioral science textbook puts it people use rewards expecting to gain the benefit of increasing another person s motivation and behavior but in so doing they often incur the unintentional and hidden cost of undermining that person s intrinsic motivation toward the activity this is one of the most robust findings in social science and also one of the most ignored despite the work of a few skilled and passionate popularizers in particular alfie kohn whose prescient 1993 book punished by rewards lays out a devastating indictment of extrinsic incentives we persist in trying to motivate people this way perhaps we re scared to let go of motivation 2 0 despite its obvious downsides perhaps we can t get our minds around the peculiar quantum mechanics of intrinsic motivation or perhaps there s a better reason even if those controlling if then rewards activate the sawyer effect and suffocate the third drive maybe they actually get people to perform better if that s the case perhaps they re not so bad so let s ask do extrinsic rewards boost performance four economists went to india to find out high performance one of the difficulties of laboratory experiments that test the impact of extrinsic motivators like cash is the cost if you re going to pay people to perform you have to pay them a meaningful amount and in the united states or europe where standards of living are high an individually meaningful amount multiplied by dozens of participants can rack up unsustainably large bills for behavioral scientists in part to circumvent this problem a quartet of economists including dan ariely whom i mentioned in the last chapter set up shop in madurai india to gauge the effects of extrinsic incentives on performance because the cost of living in rural india is much lower than in north america the researchers could offer large rewards without breaking their own banks they recruited eighty seven participants and asked them to play several games for example tossing tennis balls at a target unscrambling anagrams recalling a string of digits that required motor skills creativity or concentration to test the power of incentives the experimenters offered three types of rewards for reaching certain performance levels one third of the participants could earn a small reward 4 rupees at the time worth around 50 u s cents and equal to about a day s pay in madurai for reaching their performance targets one third could earn a medium reward 40 rupees about 5 or two weeks pay and one third could earn a very large reward 400 rupees about 50 or nearly five months pay what happened did the size of the reward predict the quality of the performance yes but not in the way you might expect as it turned out the people offered the medium sized bonus didn t perform any better than those offered the small one and those in the 400 rupee super incentivized group they fared worst of all by nearly every measure they lagged behind both the low reward and medium reward participants reporting the results for the federal reserve bank of boston the researchers wrote in eight of the nine tasks we examined across the three experiments higher incentives led to worse performance let s circle back to this conclusion for a moment four economists two from mit one from carnegie mellon and one from the university of chicago undertake research for the federal reserve system one of the most powerful economic actors in the world but instead of affirming a simple business principle higher rewards lead to higher performance they seem to refute it and it s not just american researchers reaching these counterintuitive conclusions in 2009 scholars at the london school of economics alma mater of eleven nobel laureates in economics analyzed fifty one studies of corporate pay for performance plans these economists conclusion we find that financial incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance on both sides of the atlantic the gap between what science is learning and what business is doing is wide many existing institutions provide very large incentives for exactly the type of tasks we used here ariely and his colleagues wrote our results challenge that assumption our experiment suggests that one cannot assume that introducing or raising incentives always improves performance indeed in many instances contingent incentives that cornerstone of how businesses attempt to motivate employees may be a losing proposition of course procrastinating writers notwithstanding few of us spend our working hours flinging tennis balls or doing anagrams how about the more creative tasks that are more akin to what we actually do on the job creativity for a quick test of problem solving prowess few exercises are more useful than the candle problem devised by psychologist karl duncker in the 1930s the candle problem is used in a wide variety of experiments in behavioral science follow along and see how you do you sit at a table next to a wooden wall and the experimenter gives you the materials shown below a candle some tacks and a book of matches the candle problem presented your job is to attach the candle to the wall so that the wax doesn t drip on the table think for a moment about how you d solve the problem many people begin by trying to tack the candle to the wall but that doesn t work some light a match melt the side of the candle and try to adhere it to the wall that doesn t work either but after five or ten minutes most people stumble onto the solution which you can see below the candle problem solved the key is to overcome what s called functional fixedness you look at the box and see only one function as a container for the tacks but by thinking afresh you eventually see that the box can have another function as a platform for the candle to reprise language from the previous chapter the solution isn t algorithmic following a set path but heuristic breaking from the path to discover a novel strategy what happens when you give people a conceptual challenge like this and offer them rewards for speedy solutions sam glucksberg a psychologist now at princeton university tested this a few decades ago by timing how quickly two groups of participants solved the candle problem he told the first group that he was timing their work merely to establish norms for how long it typically took someone to complete this sort of puzzle to the second group he offered incentives if a participant s time was among the fastest 25 percent of all the people being tested that participant would receive 5 if the participant s time was the fastest of all the reward would be 20 adjusted for inflation those are decent sums of money for a few minutes of effort a nice motivator how much faster did the incentivized group come up with a solution on average it took them nearly three and a half minutes longer yes three and a half minutes longer whenever i ve relayed these results to a group of businesspeople the reaction is almost always a loud pained involuntary gasp in direct contravention to the core tenets of motivation 2 0 an incentive designed to clarify thinking and sharpen creativity ended up clouding thinking and dulling creativity why rewards by their very nature narrow our focus that s helpful when there s a clear path to a solution they help us stare ahead and race faster but if then motivators are terrible for challenges like the candle problem as this experiment shows the rewards narrowed people s focus and blinkered the wide view that might have allowed them to see new uses for old objects something similar seems to occur for challenges that aren t so much about cracking an existing problem but about iterating something new teresa amabile the harvard business school professor and one of the world s leading researchers on creativity has frequently tested the effects of contingent rewards on the creative process in one study she and two colleagues recruited twenty three professional artists from the united states who had produced both commissioned and noncommissioned artwork they asked the artists to randomly select ten commissioned works and ten noncommissioned works then amabile and her team gave the works to a panel of accomplished artists and curators who knew nothing about the study and asked the experts to rate the pieces on creativity and technical skill our results were quite startling the researchers wrote the commissioned works were rated as significantly less creative than the non commissioned works yet they were not rated as different in technical quality moreover the artists reported feeling significantly more constrained when doing commissioned works than when doing non commissioned works one artist whom they interviewed describes the sawyer effect in action not always but a lot of the time when you are doing a piece for someone else it becomes more work than joy when i work for myself there is the pure joy of creating and i can work through the night and not even know it on a commissioned piece you have to check yourself be careful to do what the client wants another study of artists over a longer period shows that a concern for outside rewards might actually hinder eventual success in the early 1960s researchers surveyed sophomores and juniors at the school of the art institute of chicago about their attitudes toward work and whether they were more intrinsically or extrinsically motivated using these data as a benchmark another researcher followed up with these students in the early 1980s to see how their careers were progressing among the starkest findings especially for men the less evidence of extrinsic motivation during art school the more success in professional art both several years after graduation and nearly twenty years later painters and sculptors who were intrinsically motivated those for whom the joy of discovery and the challenge of creation were their own rewards were able to weather the tough times and the lack of remuneration and recognition that inevitably accompany artistic careers and that led to yet another paradox in the alice in wonderland world of the third drive those artists who pursued their painting and sculpture more for the pleasure of the activity itself than for extrinsic rewards have produced art that has been socially recognized as superior the study said it is those who are least motivated to pursue extrinsic rewards who eventually receive them this result is not true across all tasks of course amabile and others have found that extrinsic rewards can be effective for algorithmic tasks those that depend on following an existing formula to its logical conclusion but for more right brain undertakings those that demand flexible problem solving inventiveness or conceptual understanding contingent rewards can be dangerous rewarded subjects often have a harder time seeing the periphery and crafting original solutions this too is one of the sturdiest findings in social science especially as amabile and others have refined it over the years for artists scientists inventors schoolchildren and the rest of us intrinsic motivation the drive do something because it is interesting challenging and absorbing is essential for high levels of creativity but the if then motivators that are the staple of most businesses often stifle rather than stir creative thinking as the economy moves toward more right brain conceptual work as more of us deal with our own versions of the candle problem this might be the most alarming gap between what science knows and what business does good behavior philosophers and medical professionals have long debated whether blood donors should be paid some claim that blood like human tissue or organs is special that we shouldn t be able to buy and sell it like a barrel of crude oil or a crate of ball bearings others argue that we should shelve our squeamishness because paying for this substance will ensure an ample supply but in 1970 british sociologist richard titmuss who had studied blood donation in the united kingdom offered a bolder speculation paying for blood wasn t just immoral he said it was also inefficient if britain decided to pay citizens to donate that would actually reduce the country s blood supply it was an oddball notion to be sure economists snickered and titmuss never tested the idea it was merely a philosophical hunch but a quarter century later two swedish economists decided to see if titmuss was right in an intriguing field experiment they visited a regional blood center in gothenburg and found 153 women who were interested in giving blood then as seems to be the custom among motivation researchers they divided the women into three groups experimenters told those in the first group that blood donation was voluntary these participants could give blood but they wouldn t receive a payment the experimenters offered the second group a different arrangement if these participants gave blood they d each receive 50 swedish kronor about 7 the third group received a variation on that second offer a 50 kronor payment with an immediate option to donate the amount to a children s cancer charity of the first group 52 percent of the women decided to go ahead and donate blood they were altruistic citizens apparently willing to do a good deed for their fellow swedes even in the absence of compensation and the second group motivation 2 0 would suggest that this group might be a bit more motivated to donate they d shown up which indicated intrinsic motivation getting a few kronor on top might give that impulse a boost but as you might have guessed by now that s not what happened in this group only 30 percent of the women decided to give blood instead of increasing the number of blood donors offering to pay people decreased the number by nearly half meanwhile the third group which had the option of donating the fee directly to charity responded much the same as the first group fifty three percent became blood donors titmuss s hunch might have been right after all adding a monetary incentive didn t lead to more of the desired behavior it led to less the reason it tainted an altruistic act and crowded out the intrinsic desire to do something good doing good is what blood donation is all about it provides what the american red cross brochures say is a feeling that money can t buy that s why voluntary blood donations invariably increase during natural disasters and other calamities but if governments were to pay people to help their neighbors during these crises donations might decline that said in the swedish example the reward itself wasn t inherently destructive the immediate option to donate the 50 kronor payment rather than pocket it seemed to negate the effect this too is extremely important it s not that all rewards at all times are bad for instance when the italian government gave blood donors paid time off work donations increased the law removed an obstacle to altruism so while a few advocates would have you believe in the basic evil of extrinsic incentives that s just not empirically true what is true is that mixing rewards with inherently interesting creative or noble tasks deploying them without understanding the peculiar science of motivation is a very dangerous game when used in these situations if then rewards usually do more harm than good by neglecting the ingredients of genuine motivation autonomy mastery and purpose they limit what each of us can achieve more of what we don t want i n the upside down universe of the third drive rewards can often produce less of the very things they re trying to encourage but that s not the end of the story when used improperly extrinsic motivators can have another unintended collateral consequence they can give us more of what we don t want here again what business does hasn t caught up with what science knows and what science is revealing is that carrots and sticks can promote bad behavior create addiction and encourage short term thinking at the expense of the long view unethical behavior what could be more valuable than having a goal from our earliest days teachers coaches and parents advise us to set goals and to work mightily to achieve them and with good reason goals work the academic literature shows that by helping us tune out distractions goals can get us to try harder work longer and achieve more but recently a group of scholars from the harvard business school northwestern university s kellogg school of management the university of arizona s eller college of management and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school questioned the efficacy of this broad prescription rather than being offered as an ôover the counter salve for boosting performance goal setting should be prescribed selectively presented with a warning label and closely monitored they wrote goals that people set for themselves and that are devoted to attaining mastery are usually healthy but goals imposed by others sales targets quarterly returns standardized test scores and so on can sometimes have dangerous side effects like all extrinsic motivators goals narrow our focus that s one reason they can be effective they concentrate the mind but as we ve seen a narrowed focus exacts a cost for complex or conceptual tasks offering a reward can blinker the wide ranging thinking necessary to come up with an innovative solution likewise when an extrinsic goal is paramount particularly a short term measurable one whose achievement delivers a big payoff its presence can restrict our view of the broader dimensions of our behavior as the cadre of business school professors write substantial evidence demonstrates that in addition to motivating constructive effort goal setting can induce unethical behavior the examples are legion the researchers note sears imposes a sales quota on its auto repair staff and workers respond by overcharging customers and completing unnecessary repairs enron sets lofty revenue goals and the race to meet them by any means possible catalyzes the company s collapse ford is so intent on producing a certain car at a certain weight at a certain price by a certain date that it omits safety checks and unleashes the dangerous ford pinto the problem with making an extrinsic reward the only destination that matters is that some people will choose the quickest route there even if it means taking the low road indeed most of the scandals and misbehavior that have seemed endemic to modern life involve shortcuts executives game their quarterly earnings so they can snag a performance bonus secondary school counselors doctor student transcripts so their seniors can get into college athletes inject themselves with steroids to post better numbers and trigger lucrative performance bonuses contrast that approach with behavior sparked by intrinsic motivation when the reward is the activity itself deepening learning delighting customers doing one s best there are no shortcuts the only route to the destination is the high road in some sense it s impossible to act unethically because the person who s disadvantaged isn t a competitor but yourself of course all goals are not created equal and let me emphasize this point goals and extrinsic rewards aren t inherently corrupting but goals are more toxic than motivation 2 0 recognizes in fact the business school professors suggest they should come with their own warning label goals may cause systematic problems for organizations due to narrowed focus unethical behavior increased risk taking decreased cooperation and decreased intrinsic motivation use care when applying goals in your organization if carrots as goals sometimes encourage unworthy behavior then sticks as punishment should be able to halt it right not so fast the third drive is less mechanistic and more surprising than that as two israeli economists discovered at some day care centers in 2000 economists uri gneezy and aldo rustichini studied a group of child care facilities in haifa israel for twenty weeks the centers opened at 7 30 a m and closed at 4 00 p m parents had to retrieve their children by the closing time or a teacher would have to stay late during the first four weeks of the experiment the economists recorded how many parents arrived late each week then before the fifth week with the permission of the day care centers they posted the following sign announcement fine for coming late as you all know the official closing time of the day care center is 1600 every day since some parents have been coming late we with the approval of the authority for private day care centers in israel have decided to impose a fine on parents who come late to pick up their children as of next sunday a fine of ns 10 will be charged every time a child is collected after 1610 this fine will be calculated monthly it is to be paid together with the regular monthly payment sincerely the manager of the day care center the theory underlying the fine said gneezy and rustichini was straightforward when negative consequences are imposed on a behavior they will produce a reduction of that particular response in other words thwack the parents with a fine and they ll stop showing up late but that s not what happened after the introduction of the fine we observed a steady increase in the number of parents coming late the economists wrote the rate finally settled at a level that was higher and almost twice as large as the initial one and in language reminiscent of harry harlow s head scratching they write that the existing literature didn t account for such a result indeed the possibility of an increase in the behavior being punished was not even considered up pops another bug in motivation 2 0 one reason most parents showed up on time is that they had a relationship with the teachers who after all were caring for their precious sons and daughters and wanted to treat them fairly parents had an intrinsic desire to be scrupulous about punctuality but the threat of a fine like the promise of the kronor in the blood experiment edged aside that third drive the fine shifted the parents decision from a partly moral obligation be fair to my kids teachers to a pure transaction i can buy extra time there wasn t room for both the punishment didn t promote good behavior it crowded it out addiction if some scientists believe that if then motivators and other extrinsic rewards resemble prescription drugs that carry potentially dangerous side effects others believe they re more like illegal drugs that foster a deeper and more pernicious dependency according to these scholars cash rewards and shiny trophies can provide a delicious jolt of pleasure at first but the feeling soon dissipates and to keep it alive the recipient requires ever larger and more frequent doses the russian economist anton suvorov has constructed an elaborate econometric model to demonstrate this effect configured around what s called principal agent theory think of the principal as the motivat or the employer the teacher the parent think of the agent as the motivat ee the employee the student the child a principal essentially tries to get the agent to do what the principal wants while the agent balances his own interests with whatever the principal is offering using a blizzard of complicated equations that test a variety of scenarios between principal and agent suvorov has reached conclusions that make intuitive sense to any parent who s tried to get her kids to empty the garbage by offering a reward a principal signals to the agent that the task is undesirable if the task were desirable the agent wouldn t need a prod but that initial signal and the reward that goes with it forces the principal onto a path that s difficult to leave offer too small a reward and the agent won t comply but offer a reward that s enticing enough to get the agent to act the first time and the principal is doomed to give it again in the second there s no going back pay your son to take out the trash and you ve pretty much guaranteed the kid will never do it again for free what s more once the initial money buzz tapers off you ll likely have to increase the payment to continue compliance as suvorov explains rewards are addictive in that once offered a contingent reward makes an agent expect it whenever a similar task is faced which in turn compels the principal to use rewards over and over again and before long the existing reward may no longer suffice it will quickly feel less like a bonus and more like the status quo which then forces the principal to offer larger rewards to achieve the same effect this addictive pattern is not merely blackboard theory brian knutson then a neuroscientist at the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism demonstrated as much in an experiment using the brain scanning technique known as functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri he placed healthy volunteers into a giant scanner to watch how their brains responded during a game that involved the prospect of either winning or losing money when participants knew they had a chance to win cash activation occurred in the part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens that is when the participants anticipated getting a reward but not when they anticipated losing one a burst of the brain chemical dopamine surged to this part of the brain knutson who is now at stanford university has found similar results in subsequent studies where people anticipated rewards what makes this response interesting for our purposes is that the same basic physiological process this particular brain chemical surging to this particular part of the brain is what happens in addiction the mechanism of most addictive drugs is to send a fusillade of dopamine to the nucleus accumbens the feeling delights then dissipates then demands another dose in other words if we watch how people s brains respond promising them monetary rewards and giving them cocaine nicotine or amphetamines look disturbingly similar this could be one reason that paying people to stop smoking often works in the short run it replaces one dangerous addiction with another more benign one rewards addictive qualities can also distort decision making knutson has found that activation in the nucleus accumbens seems to predict both risky choices and risk seeking mistakes get people fired up with the prospect of rewards and instead of making better decisions as motivation 2 0 hopes they can actually make worse ones as knutson writes this may explain why casinos surround their guests with reward cues e g inexpensive food free liquor surprise gifts potential jackpot prizes anticipation of rewards activates the nucleus accumbens which may lead to an increase in the likelihood of individuals switching from risk averse to risk seeking behavior in short while that dangled carrot isn t all bad in all circumstances in some instances it operates similar to a rock of crack cocaine and can induce behavior similar to that found around the craps table or roulette wheel not exactly what we hope to achieve when we motivate our teammates and coworkers short term thinking think back to the candle problem again the incentivized participants performed worse than their counterparts because they were so focused on the prize that they failed to glimpse a novel solution on the periphery rewards we ve seen can limit the breadth of our thinking but extrinsic motivators especially tangible if then ones can also reduce the depth of our thinking they can focus our sights on only what s immediately before us rather than what s off in the distance many times a concentrated focus makes sense if your office building is on fire you want to find an exit immediately rather than ponder how to rewrite the zoning regulations but in less dramatic circumstances fixating on an immediate reward can damage performance over time indeed what our earlier examples unethical actions and addictive behavior have in common perhaps more than anything else is that they re entirely short term addicts want the quick fix regardless of the eventual harm cheaters want the quick win regardless of the lasting consequences yet even when the behavior doesn t devolve into shortcuts or addiction the near term allure of rewards can be harmful in the long run consider publicly held companies many such companies have existed for decades and hope to exist for decades more but much of what their executives and middle managers do each day is aimed single mindedly at the corporation s performance over the next three months at these companies quarterly earnings are an obsession executives devote substantial resources to making sure the earnings come out just right and they spend considerable time and brain power offering guidance to stock analysts so that the market knows what to expect and therefore responds favorably this laser focus on a narrow near term slice of corporate performance is understandable it s a rational response to stock markets that reward or punish tiny blips in those numbers which in turn affect executives compensation but companies pay a steep price for not extending their gaze beyond the next quarter several researchers have found that companies that spend the most time offering guidance on quarterly earnings deliver significantly lower long term growth rates than companies that offer guidance less frequently one reason the earnings obsessed companies typically invest less in research and development they successfully achieve their short term goals but threaten the health of the company two or three years hence as the scholars who warned about goals gone wild put it the very presence of goals may lead employees to focus myopically on short term gains and to lose sight of the potential devastating long term effects on the organization perhaps nowhere is this clearer than in the economic calamity that gripped the world economy in 2008 and 2009 each player in the system focused only on the short term reward the buyer who wanted a house the mortgage broker who wanted a commission the wall street trader who wanted new securities to sell the politician who wanted a buoyant economy during reelection and ignored the long term effects of their actions on themselves or others when the music stopped the entire system nearly collapsed this is the nature of economic bubbles what seems to be irrational exuberance is ultimately a bad case of extrinsically motivated myopia by contrast the elements of genuine motivation that we ll explore later by their very nature defy a short term view take mastery the objective itself is inherently long term because complete mastery in a sense is unattainable even roger federer for instance will never fully master the game of tennis but introducing an if then reward to help develop mastery usually backfires that s why schoolchildren who are paid to solve problems typically choose easier problems and therefore learn less the short term prize crowds out the l ong term learning in environments where extrinsic rewards are most salient many people work only to the point that triggers the reward and no further so if students get a prize for reading three books many won t pick up a fourth let alone embark on a lifetime of reading just as executives who hit their quarterly numbers often won t boost earnings a penny more let alone contemplate the long term health of their company likewise several studies show that paying people to exercise stop smoking or take their medicines produces terrific results at first but the healthy behavior disappears once the incentives are removed however when contingent rewards aren t involved or when incentives are used with the proper deftness performance improves and understanding deepens greatness and nearsightedness are incompatible meaningful achievement depends on lifting one s sights and pushing toward the horizon carrots and sticks the seven deadly flaws 1 they can extinguish intrinsic motivation 2 they can diminish performance 3 they can crush creativity 4 they can crowd out good behavior 5 they can encourage cheating shortcuts and unethical behavior 6 they can become addictive 7 they can foster short term thinking drive chapter 2a and the special circumstances when they do c arrots and sticks aren t all bad if they were motivation 2 0 would never have flourished so long or accomplished so much while an operating system centered around rewards and punishments has outlived its usefulness and badly needs an upgrade that doesn t mean we should scrap its every piece indeed doing so would run counter to the science the scholars exploring human motivation have revealed not only the many glitches in the traditional approach but also the narrow band of circumstances in which carrots and sticks do their jobs reasonably well the starting point of course is to ensure that the baseline rewards wages salaries benefits and so on are adequate and fair without a healthy baseline motivation of any sort is difficult and often impossible but once that s established there are circumstances where it s okay to fall back on extrinsic motivators to understand what those circumstances are let s return to the candle problem in his study sam glucksberg found that the participants who were offered a cash prize took longer to solve the problem than those working in a reward free environment the reason you ll recall is that the prospect of a prize narrowed participants focus and limited their ability to see an inventive nonobvious solution in the same experiment glucksberg presented a separate set of participants with a slightly different version of the problem once again he told half of them he was timing their performance to collect data and the other half that those who posted the fastest times could win cash but he altered things just a bit instead of giving participants a box full of tacks he emptied the tacks onto the desk as shown below the candle problem presented differently can you guess what happened this time the participants vying for the reward solved the problem faster than their counterparts why by removing the tacks and displaying the empty box glucksberg essentially revealed the solution he transformed a challenging right brain task into a routine left brain one since participants simply had to race down an obvious path the carrot waiting for them at the finish line encouraged them to gallop faster glucksberg s experiment provides the first question you should ask when contemplating external motivators is the task at hand routine that is does accomplishing it require following a prescribed set of rules to a specified end for routine tasks which aren t very interesting and don t demand much creative thinking rewards can provide a small motivational booster shot without the harmful side effects in some ways that s just common sense as edward deci richard ryan and richard koestner explain rewards do not undermine people s intrinsic motivation for dull tasks because there is little or no intrinsic motivation to be undermined likewise when dan ariely and his colleagues conducted their madurai india performance study with a group of mit students they found that when the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill a larger reward led to poorer performance but as long as the task involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected the higher the pay the better the performance this is extremely important although advanced economies now revolve less around those algorithmic rule based functions some of what we do each day especially on the job still isn t all that interesting we have tps reports to fill out and boring e mail to answer and all manner of drudge work that doesn t necessarily fire our soul what s more for some people much of what they do all day consists of these routine not terribly captivating tasks in these situations it s best to try to unleash the positive side of the sawyer effect by attempting to turn work into play to increase the task s variety to make it more like a game or to use it to help master other skills alas that s not always possible and this means that sometimes even if then rewards are an option let s put this insight about rewards and routines into practice suppose you re a manager at a small nonprofit organization your design team created a terrific poster promoting your group s next big event and now you need to send the poster to twenty thousand members of your organization since the costs of outsourcing the job to a professional mailing firm are too steep for your budget you decide to do the work in house trouble is the posters came back from the printer much later than you expected and they need to get in the mail this weekend what s the best way to enlist your staff of ten and maybe a few others in a massive weekend poster mailing session the task is the very definition of routine the people participating must roll up the posters slide them into the mailing tubes cap those tubes and apply a mailing label and the proper postage four steps none of them notably interesting one managerial option is coercion if you re the boss you could force people to spend their saturday and sunday on this mind numbing project they might comply but the damage to their morale and long term commitment could be substantial another option is to ask for volunteers but face it most people can think of far better ways to spend a weekend so in this case an if then reward might be effective for instance you could promise a big office wide party if everybody pitches in on the project you could offer a gift certificate to everyone who participates or you could go further and pay people a small sum for every poster they insert enclose and send in the hope that the piecework fee will boost their productivity while such tangible contingent rewards can often undermine intrinsic motivation and creativity those drawbacks matter less here the assignment neither inspires deep passion nor requires deep thinking carrots in this case won t hurt and might help and you ll increase your chances of success by supplementing the poster packing rewards with three important practices offer a rationale for why the task is necessary a job that s not inherently interesting can become more meaningful and therefore more engaging if it s part of a larger purpose explain why this poster is so important and why sending it out now is critical to your organization s mission acknowledge that the task is boring this is an act of empathy of course and the acknowledgment will help people understand why this is the rare instance when if then rewards are part of how your organization operates allow people to complete the task their own way think autonomy not control state the outcome you need but instead of specifying precisely the way to reach it how each poster must be rolled and how each mailing label must be affixed give them freedom over how they do the job that s the approach for routine tasks what about for other sorts of undertakings for work that requires more than just climbing rung by rung up a ladder of instructions rewards are more perilous the best way to avoid the seven deadly flaws of extrinsic motivators is to avoid them altogether or to downplay them significantly and instead emphasize the elements of deeper motivation autonomy mastery and purpose that we ll explore later in the book but in the workplace a rigid adherence to this approach bumps up against a fact of life even people who do groovy creative right brain work still want to be paid and here teresa amabile has shed some light on how to use rewards in a way that reckons with life s realities but reduces extrinsic motivators hidden costs go back to the study in which amabile and two colleagues compared the quality of commissioned and noncommissioned paintings from a group of artists a panel of experts blind to what the investigators were exploring consistently rated the noncommissioned artwork as more creative one reason is that several artists said their commissions were constraining that they found themselves working toward a goal they didn t endorse in a manner they didn t control however in the same study amabile also discovered that when the artists considered their commissions enabling that is the commission enabled the artist to do something interesting or exciting the creativity ranking of what they produced shot back up the same was true for commissions the artists felt provided them with useful information and feedback about their ability this is a crucial research insight the science shows that it is possible though tricky to incorporate rewards into nonroutine more creative settings without causing a cascade of damage so suppose we re back at your nonprofit nine months later the mailing went out flawlessly the poster was a hit the event was a smash you re planning another for later this year you ve settled on the date and found your venue now you need an inspiring poster to captivate imaginations and draw a crowd what should you do here s what you shouldn t do offer an if then reward to the design staff do not stride into their offices and announce if you come up with a poster that rocks my world or that boosts attendance over last year then you ll get a ten percent bonus although that motivational approach is common in organizations all over the world it s a recipe for reduced performance creating a poster isn t routine it requires conceptual breakthrough artistic thinking and as we ve learned if then rewards are an ideal way to squash this sort of thinking your best approach is to have already established the conditions of a genuinely motivating environment the baseline rewards must be sufficient that is the team s basic compensation must be adequate and fair particularly compared with people doing similar work for similar organizations your nonprofit must be a congenial place to work and the people on your team must have autonomy they must have ample opportunity to pursue mastery and their daily duties must relate to a larger purpose if these elements are in place the best strategy is to provide a sense of urgency and significance and then get out of the talent s way but you may still be able to boost performance a bit more for future tasks than for this one through the delicate use of rewards just be careful your efforts will backfire unless the rewards you offer meet one essential requirement and you ll be on firmer motivational footing if you follow two additional principles the essential requirement any extrinsic reward should be unexpected and offered only after the task is complete holding out a prize at the beginning of a project and offering it as a contingency will inevitably focus people s attention on obtaining the reward rather than on attacking the problem but introducing the subject of rewards after the job is done is less risky in other words where if then rewards are a mistake shift to now that rewards as in now that you ve finished the poster and it turned out so well i d like to celebrate by taking you out to lunch as deci and his colleagues explain if tangible rewards are given unexpectedly to people after they have finished a task the rewards are less likely to be experienced as the reason for doing the task and are thus less likely to be detrimental to intrinsic motivation likewise amabile has found in some studies that the highest levels of creativity were produced by subjects who received a reward as a kind of a bonus so when the poster turns out great you could buy the design team a case of beer or even hand them a cash bonus without snuffing their creativity the team didn t expect any extras and getting them didn t hinge on a particular outcome you re simply offering your appreciation for their stellar work but keep in mind one ginormous caveat repeated now that bonuses can quickly become expected if then entitlements which can ultimately crater effective performance at this point by limiting rewards for nonroutine creative work to the unexpected now that variety you re in less dangerous waters but you ll do even better if you follow two more guidelines first consider nontangible rewards praise and positive feedback are much less corrosive than cash and trophies in fact in deci s original experiments and in his subsequent analysis of other studies he found that positive feedback can have an enhancing effect on intrinsic motivation so if the folks on the design team turn out a show stopping poster maybe just walk into their offices and say wow you really did an amazing job on that poster it s going to have a huge impact on getting people to come to this event thank you it sounds small and simple but it can have an enormous effect second provide useful information amabile has found that while controlling extrinsic motivators can clobber creativity informational or enabling motivators can be conducive to it in the workplace people are thirsting to learn about how they re doing but only if the information isn t a tacit effort to manipulate their behavior so don t tell the design team that poster was perfect you did it exactly the way i asked instead give people meaningful information about their work the more feedback focuses on specifics great use of color and the more the praise is about effort and strategy rather than about achieving a particular outcome the more effective it can be in brief for creative right brain heuristic tasks you re on shaky ground offering if then rewards you re better off using now that rewards and you re best off if your now that rewards provide praise feedback and useful information for a visual depiction of this approach see the flowchart on the next page when to use rewards a simple flowchart drive chapter 3 type i and type x r ochester new york is an unlikely epicenter for a social earthquake the companies that built this stolid city just sixty two miles from the canadian border were titans of the industrial economy eastman kodak made film western union delivered telegrams xerox produced photocopiers and they piloted their enterprises by the precepts of motivation 2 0 if you offer people steady employment and carefully calibrated rewards they ll do what executives and shareholders want and everyone will prosper but starting in the 1970s on the campus of the university of rochester a motivational revolution was brewing it began in 1971 when edward deci fresh from his soma puzzle experiments arrived on campus for a joint appointment in the psychology department and the business school it intensified in 1973 when the business school unceremoniously booted deci because of his heretical findings about rewards and the psychology department hired him full time it gathered more steam in 1975 when deci published a book called intrinsic motivation and it launched in earnest in 1977 when a student named richard ryan showed up for graduate school ryan a philosophy major in college had just missed being drafted into the military nursing a bit of survivor s guilt he d been working with vietnam war veterans suffering from post traumatic stress disorder and he d come to the university of rochester to learn how to become a better clinician one day in a seminar a professor brought up the subject of intrinsic motivation and then denounced it with table pounding ferocity i figured that if there was that much resistance this must be something interesting ryan told me he picked up a copy of deci s book found it compelling and asked its author to lunch so commenced a remarkable research collaboration that continues to this day when i met them not long ago in u of r s blocky meliora hall the two were a study in both contrast and similarity deci is tall and reedy with a pale complexion and thin wispy hair he speaks in a quiet soothing voice that reminded me of the late american children s television host mr rogers ryan who has straight white hair parted down the middle is ruddier and more intense he presses his point like a skilled litigator deci meanwhile waits patiently for you to reach his point then he agrees with you and praises your insight deci is the classical music station on your fm dial ryan is more cable tv and yet they talk to each other in a cryptic academic shorthand their ideas smoothly in sync the combination has been powerful enough to make them among the most influential behavioral scientists of their generation together deci and ryan have fashioned what they call self determination theory many theories of behavior pivot around a particular human tendency we re keen responders to positive and negative reinforcements or zippy calculators of our self interest or lumpy duffel bags of psychosexual conflicts sdt by contrast begins with a notion of universal human needs it argues that we have three innate psychological needs competence autonomy and relatedness when those needs are satisfied we re motivated productive and happy when they re thwarted our motivation productivity and happiness plummet if there s anything fundamental about our nature it s the capacity for interest some things facilitate it some things undermine it ryan explained during one of our conversations put another way we ve all got that third drive it s part of what it means to be human but whether that aspect of our humanity emerges in our lives depends on whether the conditions around us support it and the main mechanisms of motivation 2 0 are more stifling than supportive this is a really big thing in management says ryan when people aren t producing companies typically resort to rewards or punishment what you haven t done is the hard work of diagnosing what the problem is you re trying to run over the problem with a carrot or a stick ryan explains that doesn t mean that sdt unequivocally opposes rewards of course they re necessary in workplaces and other settings says deci but the less salient they are made the better when people use rewards to motivate that s when they re most demotivating instead deci and ryan say we should focus our efforts on creating environments for our innate psychological needs to flourish over the last thirty years through both their scholarship and mentorship deci and ryan have established a network of several dozen sdt scholars conducting research in the united states canada israel singapore and throughout western europe these scientists have explored self determination and intrinsic motivation in laboratory experiments and field studies that encompass just about every realm business education medicine sports exercise personal productivity environmentalism relationships and physical and mental health they have produced hundreds of research papers most of which point to the same conclusion human beings have an innate inner drive to be autonomous self determined and connected to one another and when that drive is liberated people achieve more and live richer lives sdt is an important part of a broad swirl of new thinking about the human condition this constellation includes perhaps most prominently the positive psychology movement which has reoriented the study of psychological science away from its previous focus on malady and dysfunction and toward well being and effective functioning under the leadership of the university of pennsylvania s martin seligman positive psychology has been minting legions of new scholars and leaving a deep imprint on how scientists economists therapists and everyday people think about human behavior one of positive psychology s most influential figures is mihaly csikszentmihalyi whom i mentioned earlier csikszentmihalyi s first book about flow and seligman s first book on his theories which argued that helplessness was learned rather than innate behavior appeared in the same year as deci s book on intrinsic motivation clearly something big was in the air in 1975 it s just taken us a generation to reckon with it the broad assortment of new thinkers includes carol dweck of stanford university and harvard s amabile it includes a few economists most prominently roland bžnabou of princeton university and bruno frey of the university of zurich who are applying some of these concepts to the dismal science and it includes some scholars who don t study motivation per se in particular harvard university s howard gardner and tufts university s robert sternberg who have changed our view of intelligence and creativity and offered a brighter view of human potential this collection of scholars not in concert not intentionally and perhaps not even knowing they ve been doing so has been creating the foundation for a new more effective operating system at long last the times may be catching up to their work the power of the alphabet w ords matter of course but so do letters case in point meyer friedman you ve probably never heard of him but you almost certainly know his legacy friedman who died in 2001 at the ripe old age of ninety was a cardiologist who for decades ran a bustling office in san francisco in the late 1950s he and fellow physician ray rosenman began noticing similarities in their patients who were prone to heart disease it wasn t only what these patients ate or what genes they inherited that affected their susceptibility to coronary trouble it was also how they led their lives these patients friedman noted demonstrated a particular complex of personality traits including excessive competition drive aggressiveness impatience and a harrying sense of time urgency individuals displaying this pattern seem to be engaged in a chronic ceaseless and often fruitless struggle with themselves with others with circumstances with time sometimes with life itself these people were significantly more likely to develop heart disease than other patients even those who shared similar physical attributes exercise regimens diets and family histories looking for a convenient and memorable way to explain this insight to their medical colleagues and the wider world friedman and rosenman found inspiration in the alphabet they dubbed this behavioral pattern type a type a behavior stood in contrast to natch type b behavior unlike their horn honking foot tapping counterparts who suffered from hurry sickness people displaying type b behavior were rarely harried by life or made hostile by its demands in their research friedman and rosenman found that type b people were just as intelligent and frequently just as ambitious as type a s but they wore their ambition differently writing about the type b person and using the male centered language common in the day the cardiologists explained he may also have a considerable amount of ôdrive but its character is such that it seems to steady him give confidence and security to him rather than to goad irritate and infuriate as with the type a man one key to reducing deaths from heart disease and improving public health therefore was to help type a s learn to become a little more like type b s nearly fifty years later this nomenclature remains the two letters help us understand a complex web of behaviors and guide us toward a better and more effective way to live around the same time that friedman and rosenman were making their discovery another american was pushing frontiers of his own douglas mcgregor was a management professor at mit who brought to the job an interesting combination of experiences he d earned a ph d from harvard in psychology rather than in economics or engineering and in contrast to most of his colleagues he d actually run an institution from 1948 to 1954 he was president of antioch college drawing on his understanding of the human psyche as well as his experience as a leader mcgregor began rethinking the conventions of modern management he thought that the problem with corporate leadership wasn t so much its execution as its premises beginning with a speech in 1957 and later in a groundbreaking book called the human side of enterprise in 1960 mcgregor argued that those running companies were operating from faulty assumptions about human behavior most leaders believed that the people in their organizations fundamentally disliked work and would avoid it if it they could these faceless minions feared taking responsibility craved security and badly needed direction as a result most people must be coerced controlled directed and threatened with punishment to get them to put forth adequate effort toward the achievement of organizational objectives but mcgregor said there was an alternative view of employees one that offered a more accurate assessment of the human condition and a more effective starting point for running companies this perspective held that taking an interest in work is as natural as play or rest that creativity and ingenuity were widely distributed in the population and that under the proper conditions people will accept and even seek responsibility to explain these contrasting outlooks mcgregor mined the back end of the alphabet he called the first view theory x and the second theory y if your starting point was theory x he said your managerial techniques would inevitably produce limited results or even go awry entirely if you believed in the mediocrity of the masses as he put it then mediocrity became the ceiling on what you could achieve but if your starting point was theory y the possibilities were vast not simply for the individual s potential but for the company s bottom line as well the way to make business organizations work better therefore was to shift management thinking away from theory x and toward theory y once again the nomenclature stuck and mcgregor s approach soon became a staple of management education a picture may be worth a thousand words but sometimes neither is as potent as just two letters so with a hoist from meyer friedman onto the shoulders of douglas mcgregor i d like to introduce my own alphabetic way to think about human motivation type i and type x t he motivation 2 0 operating system depended on and fostered what i call type x behavior type x behavior is fueled more by extrinsic desires than intrinsic ones it concerns itself less with the inherent satisfaction of an activity and more with the external rewards to which that activity leads the motivation 3 0 operating system the upgrade that s needed to meet the new realities of how we organize think about and do what we do depends on what i call type i behavior type i behavior is fueled more by intrinsic desires than extrinsic ones it concerns itself less with the external rewards to which an activity leads and more with the inherent satisfaction of the activity itself at the center of type x behavior is the second drive at the center of type i behavior is the third drive if we want to strengthen our organizations get beyond our decade of underachievement and address the inchoate sense that something s gone wrong in our businesses our lives and our world we need to move from type x to type i i use these two letters largely to signify extrinsic and intrinsic but also to pay homage to douglas mcgregor to be sure reducing human behavior to two categories sacrifices a certain amount of nuance and nobody exhibits purely type x or type i behavior every waking minute of every living day without exception but we do have certain often very clear dispositions you probably know what i mean think about yourself does what energizes you what gets you up in the morning and propels you through the day come from the inside or from the outside what about your spouse your partner or your children how about the men and women around you at work if you re like most people i ve talked to you instantly have a sense into which category someone belongs i don t mean to say that type x people always neglect the inherent enjoyment of what they do or that type i people resist outside goodies of any kind but for type x s the main motivator is external rewards any deeper satisfaction is welcome but secondary for type i s the main motivator is the freedom challenge and purpose of the undertaking itself any other gains are welcome but mainly as a bonus a few more distinctions to keep in mind before we go further type i behavior is made not born these behavioral patterns aren t fixed traits they are proclivities that emerge from circumstance experience and context type i behavior because it arises in part from universal human needs does not depend on age gender or nationality the science demonstrates that once people learn the fundamental practices and attitudes and can exercise them in supportive settings their motivation and their ultimate performance soars any type x can become a type i type i s almost always outperform type x s in the long run intrinsically motivated people usually achieve more than their reward seeking counterparts alas that s not always true in the short term an intense focus on extrinsic rewards can indeed deliver fast results the trouble is this approach is difficult to sustain and it doesn t assist in mastery which is the source of achievement over the long haul the most successful people the evidence shows often aren t directly pursuing conventional notions of success they re working hard and persisting through difficulties because of their internal desire to control their lives learn about their world and accomplish something that endures type i behavior does not disdain money or recognition both type x s and type i s care about money if an employee s compensation doesn t hit the baseline that i described in chapter 2 if her organization doesn t pay her an adequate amount or if her pay isn t equitable compared to others doing similar work that person s motivation will crater regardless of whether she leans toward x or toward i however once compensation meets that level money plays a different role for type i s than for type x s type i s don t turn down raises or refuse to cash paychecks but one reason fair and adequate pay is so essential is that it takes the issue of money off the table so they can focus on the work itself by contrast for many type x s money is the table it s why they do what they do recognition is similar type i s like being recognized for their accomplishments because recognition is a form of feedback but for them unlike for type x s recognition is not a goal in itself type i behavior is a renewable resource think of type x behavior as coal and type i behavior as the sun for most of recent history coal has been the cheapest easiest most efficient resource but coal has two downsides first it produces nasty things like air pollution and greenhouse gases second it s finite getting more of it becomes increasingly difficult and expensive each year type x behavior is similar an emphasis on rewards and punishments spews its own externalities as enumerated in chapter 2 and if then motivators always grow more expensive but type i behavior which is built around intrinsic motivation draws on resources that are easily replenished and inflict little damage it is the motivational equivalent of clean energy inexpensive safe to use and endlessly renewable type i behavior promotes greater physical and mental well being according to a raft of studies from sdt researchers people oriented toward autonomy and intrinsic motivation have higher self esteem better interpersonal relationships and greater general well being than those who are extrinsically motivated by contrast people whose core aspirations are type x validations such as money fame or beauty tend to have poorer psychological health there s even a connection between type x and type a deci found that those oriented toward control and extrinsic rewards showed greater public self consciousness acted more defensively and were more likely to exhibit the type a behavior pattern ultimately type i behavior depends on three nutrients autonomy mastery and purpose type i behavior is self directed it is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters and it connects that quest for excellence to a larger purpose some might dismiss notions like these as gooey and idealistic but the science says otherwise the science confirms that this sort of behavior is essential to being human and that now in a rapidly changing economy it is also critical for professional personal and organizational success of any kind so we have a choice we can cling to a view of human motivation that is grounded more in old habits than in modern science or we can listen to the research drag our business and personal practices into the twenty first century and craft a new operating system to help ourselves our companies and our world work a little better it won t be easy it won t happen overnight so let s get started drive part two the three elements drive chapter 4 autonomy i ve seen the future and it works it works in around the clock bursts in sydney australia it works on guerrilla style side projects in mountain view california and it works whenever it damn well pleases in charlottesville virginia the reason why it works is because of how it works on the edges of the economy slowly but inexorably old fashioned ideas of management are giving way to a newfangled emphasis on self direction that s why a little past noon on a rainy friday in charlottesville only a third of ceo jeff gunther s employees have shown up for work but gunther entrepreneur manager capitalist is neither worried nor annoyed in fact he s as calm and focused as a monk maybe that s because he didn t roll into the office himself until about an hour ago or maybe that s because he knows his crew isn t shirking they re working just on their own terms at the beginning of the year gunther launched an experiment in autonomy at meddius one of a trio of companies he runs he turned the company which creates computer software and hardware to help hospitals integrate their information systems into a rowe a r esults only work environment rowes are the brainchild of cali ressler and jody thompson two former human resources executives at the american retailer best buy rowe s principles marry the commonsense pragmatism of ben franklin to the cage rattling radicalism of saul alinsky in a rowe workplace people don t have schedules they show up when they want they don t have to be in the office at a certain time or any time for that matter they just have to get their work done how they do it when they do it and where they do it is up to them that appealed to gunther who s in his early thirties management isn t about walking around and seeing if people are in their offices he told me it s about creating conditions for people to do their best work that s why he d always tried to give employees a long leash but as meddius expanded and as gunther began exploring new office space he started wondering whether talented grown up employees doing sophisticated work needed a leash of any length so at the company s holiday dinner in december 2008 he made an announcement for the first ninety days of the new year the entire twenty two person operation would try an experiment it would become a rowe in the beginning people didn t take to it gunther says the office filled up around nine a m and emptied out in the early evening just as before a few staffers had come out of extremely controlling environments and weren t accustomed to this kind of leeway at one employee s previous company staff had to arrive each day by eight a m if someone was late even by a few minutes the employee had to write an explanation for everyone else to read but after a few weeks most people found their groove productivity rose stress declined and although two employees struggled with the freedom and left by the end of the test period gunther decided to go with rowe permanently some people outside of the company thought i was crazy he says they wondered ôhow can you know what your employees are doing if they re not here but in his view the team was accomplishing more under this new arrangement one reason they were focused on the work itself rather than on whether someone would call them a slacker for leaving at three p m to watch a daughter s soccer game and since the bulk of his staff consists of software developers designers and others doing high level creative work that was essential for them it s all about craftsmanship and they need a lot of autonomy people still had specific goals they had to reach for example completing a project by a certain time or ringing up a particular number of sales and if they needed help gunther was there to assist but he decided against tying those goals to compensation that creates a culture that says it s all about the money and not enough about the work money he believes is only a threshold motivator people must be paid well and be able to take care of their families he says but once a company meets this baseline dollars and cents don t much affect performance and motivation indeed gunther thinks that in a rowe environment employees are far less likely to jump to another job for a 10 000 or even 20 000 increase in salary the freedom they have to do great work is more valuable and harder to match than a pay raise and employees spouses partners and families are among rowe s staunchest advocates more companies will migrate to this as more business owners my age come up my dad s generation views human beings as human resources they re the two by fours you need to build your house he says for me it s a partnership between me and the employees they re not resources they re partners and partners like all of us need to direct their own lives players or pawns w e forget sometimes that management does not emanate from nature it s not like a tree or a river it s like a television or a bicycle it s something that humans invented as the strategy guru gary hamel has observed management is a technology and like motivation 2 0 it s a technology that has grown creaky while some companies have oiled the gears a bit and plenty more have paid lip service to the same at its core management hasn t changed much in a hundred years its central ethic remains control its chief tools remain extrinsic motivators that leaves it largely out of sync with the nonroutine right brain abilities on which many of the world s economies now depend but could its most glaring weakness run deeper is management as it s currently constituted out of sync with human nature itself the idea of management that is management of people rather than management of say supply chains is built on certain assumptions about the basic natures of those being managed it presumes that to take action or move forward we need a prod that absent a reward or punishment we d remain happily and inertly in place it also presumes that once people do get moving they need direction that without a firm and reliable guide they d wander but is that really our fundamental nature or to use yet another computer metaphor is that our default setting when we enter the world are we wired to be passive and inert or are we wired to be active and engaged i m convinced it s the latter that our basic nature is to be curious and self directed and i say that not because i m a dewy eyed idealist but because i ve been around young children and because my wife and i have three kids of our own have you ever seen a six month old or a one year old who s not curious and self directed i haven t that s how we are out of the box if at age fourteen or forty three we re passive and inert that s not because it s our nature it s because something flipped our default setting that something could well be management not merely how bosses treat us at work but also how the broader ethos has leeched into schools families and many other aspects of our lives perhaps management isn t responding to our supposedly natural state of passive inertia perhaps management is one of the forces that s switching our default setting and producing that state now that s not as insidious as it sounds submerging part of our nature in the name of economic survival can be a sensible move my ancestors did it so did yours and there are times even now when we have no other choice but today economic accomplishment not to mention personal fulfillment more often swings on a different hinge it depends not on keeping our nature submerged but on allowing it to surface it requires resisting the temptation to control people and instead doing everything we can to reawaken their deep seated sense of autonomy this innate capacity for self direction is at the heart of motivation 3 0 and type i behavior the fundamentally autonomous quality of human nature is central to self determination theory sdt as i explained in the previous chapter deci and ryan cite autonomy as one of three basic human needs and of the three it s the most important the sun around which sdt s planets orbit in the 1980s as they progressed in their work deci and ryan moved away from categorizing behavior as either extrinsically motivated or intrinsically motivated to categorizing it as either controlled or autonomous autonomous motivation involves behaving with a full sense of volition and choice they write whereas controlled motivation involves behaving with the experience of pressure and demand toward specific outcomes that comes from forces perceived to be external to the self the ultimate freedom for creative groups is the freedom to experiment with new ideas some skeptics insist that innovation is expensive in the long run innovation is cheap mediocrity is expensive and autonomy can be the antidote tom kelleygeneral manager ideo autonomy as they see it is different from independence it s not the rugged go it alone rely on nobody individualism of the american cowboy it means acting with choice which means we can be both autonomous and happily interdependent with others and while the idea of independence has national and political reverberations autonomy appears to be a human concept rather than a western one researchers have found a link between autonomy and overall well being not only in north america and western europe but also in russia turkey and south korea even in high poverty non western locales like bangladesh social scientists have found that autonomy is something that people seek and that improves their lives a sense of autonomy has a powerful effect on individual performance and attitude according to a cluster of recent behavioral science studies autonomous motivation promotes greater conceptual understanding better grades enhanced persistence at school and in sporting activities higher productivity less burnout and greater levels of psychological well being those effects carry over to the workplace in 2004 deci and ryan along with paul baard of fordham university carried out a study of workers at an american investment bank the three researchers found greater job satisfaction among employees whose bosses offered autonomy support these bosses saw issues from the employee s point of view gave meaningful feedback and information provided ample choice over what to do and how to do it and encouraged employees to take on new projects the resulting enhancement in job satisfaction in turn led to higher performance on the job what s more the benefits that autonomy confers on individuals extend to their organizations for example researchers at cornell university studied 320 small businesses half of which granted workers autonomy the other half relying on top down direction the businesses that offered autonomy grew at four times the rate of the control oriented firms and had one third the turnover yet too many businesses remain woefully behind the science most twenty first century notions of management presume that in the end people are pawns rather than players british economist francis green to cite just one example points to the lack of individual discretion at work as the main explanation for declining productivity and job satisfaction in the uk management still revolves largely around supervision if then rewards and other forms of control that s true even of the kinder gentler motivation 2 1 approach that whispers sweetly about things like empowerment and flexibility indeed just consider the very notion of empowerment it presumes that the organization has the power and benevolently ladles some of it into the waiting bowls of grateful employees but that s not autonomy that s just a slightly more civilized form of control or take management s embrace of flex time ressler and thompson call it a con game and they re right flexibility simply widens the fences and occasionally opens the gates it too is little more than control in sheep s clothing the words themselves reflect presumptions that run against both the texture of the times and the nature of the human condition in short management isn t the solution it s the problem perhaps it s time to toss the very word management onto the linguistic ash heap alongside icebox and horseless carriage this era doesn t call for better management it calls for a renaissance of self direction the four essentials i n 2002 scott farquhar and mike cannon brookes two wet behind the ears australians just out of university borrowed 10 000 on their credit cards to start a software company they anointed their venture with a bold name atlassian after the greek titan atlas who bore the world on his shoulders and they set about creating a company to compete against some of the big names in enterprise software at the time their venture seemed loony today it seems inspired through its combination of great computer code and smart business practices atlassian now rakes in about 35 million per year and employs nearly two hundred people in offices in sydney amsterdam and san francisco but like any good entrepreneur cannon brookes walks through life beneath a cloud of perpetual dissatisfaction he d seen successful companies stagnate and wished to avoid that fate for his so to spark even greater creativity among his team and to make sure atlassian s programmers were having fun at work he decided to encourage them to spend a day working on any problem they wanted even if it wasn t part of their regular job this offbeat off day gave birth to several ideas for new products and plenty of repairs and patches on existing ones so cannon brookes decided to make the practice a permanent part of the atlassian culture now once a quarter the company sets aside an entire day when its engineers can work on any software problem they want only this time to get them out of the day to day it must be something that s not part of their regular job at two p m on a thursday the day begins engineers including cannon brookes himself crash out new code or an elegant hack any way they want with anyone they want many work through the night then at four p m on friday they show the results to the rest of the company in a wild and woolly all hands meeting stocked with ample quantities of cold beer and chocolate cake atlassian calls these twenty four hour bursts of freedom and creativity fedex days because people have to deliver something overnight and deliver atlassians have over the years this odd little exercise has produced an array of software fixes that might otherwise never have emerged says one engineer some of the coolest stuff we have in our product today has come from fedex days this isn t a pay for performance plan grounded in the mechanistic assumptions of motivation 2 0 it s an autonomy plan nicely tuned to the alternate strains of motivation 3 0 we ve always taken the position that money is only something you can lose on cannon brookes told me if you don t pay enough you can lose people but beyond that money is not a motivator what matters are these other features and what a few future facing businesses are discovering is that one of these essential features is autonomy in particular autonomy over four aspects of work what people do when they do it how they do it and whom they do it with as atlassian s experience shows type i behavior emerges when people have autonomy over the four t s their task their time their technique and their team task cannon brookes was still dissatisfied fedex days were working fine but they had an inherent weakness you built something in twenty four hours but you didn t get any more time to work on it he says so he and cofounder farquhar decided to double down their bet on employee autonomy in the spring of 2008 they announced that for the next six months atlassian developers could spend 20 percent of their time rather than just one intense day working on any project they wanted as cannon brookes explained in a blog post to employees a startup engineer must be all things he or she is a full time software developer and a part time product manager customer support guru internal systems maven as a company grows an engineer spends less time building the things he personally wants in the product our hope is that 20 time gives engineers back dedicated stack time of their own direction to spend on product innovation features plugins fixes or additions that they think are the most important this practice has a sturdy tradition and a well known modern expression its pioneer was the american company 3m in the 1930s and 1940s 3m s president and chairman was william mcknight a fellow who was as unassuming in his manner as he was visionary in his thinking mcknight believed in a simple and at the time subversive credo hire good people and leave them alone well before it was fashionable for managers to flap on about empowerment he made a more vigorous case for autonomy those men and women to whom we delegate authority and responsibility if they are good people are going to want to do their jobs in their own way he wrote in 1948 mcknight even encouraged employees to engage in what he called experimental doodling as an entrepreneur i m blessed with 100 autonomy over task time technique and team here s the thing if i maintain that autonomy i fail i fail to ship i fail to excel i fail to focus i inevitably end up either with no product or a product the market rejects the art of the art is picking your limits that s the autonomy i most cherish the freedom to pick my boundaries seth godin author of tribes purple cow and the world s most popular marketing blog with these unorthodox ideas percolating in his mind this unlikely corporate heretic established a new policy 3m s technical staff could spend up to 15 percent of their time on projects of their choosing the initiative felt so counter to the mores of motivation 2 0 so seemingly illicit that inside the company it was known as the bootlegging policy and yet it worked these walled gardens of autonomy soon became fertile fields for a harvest of innovations including post it notes scientist art fry came up with his idea for the ubiquitous stickie not in one of his regular assignments but during his 15 percent time today post its are a monumental business 3m offers more than six hundred post it products in more than one hundred countries and their cultural impact might be even greater consider but for mcknight s early push for autonomy we d be living in a world without any small yellow squares stuck to our computer monitors a chilling thought indeed according to 3m s former head of research and development most of the inventions that the company relies on even today emerged from those periods of bootlegging and experimental doodling mcknight s innovation remains in place at 3m but only a surprisingly small number of other companies have moved in this direction despite its proven results the best known company to embrace it is google which has long encouraged engineers to spend one day a week working on a side project some googlers use their 20 percent time to fix an existing product but most use it to develop something entirely new of course google doesn t sign away the intellectual property rights to what s created during that 20 percent which is wise in a typical year more than half of google s new offerings are birthed during this period of pure autonomy for example scientist krishna bharat frustrated by how difficult it was to find news stories online created google news in his 20 percent time the site now receives millions of visitors every day former google engineer paul bucheit created gmail now one of the world s most popular e mail programs as his 20 percent project many other google products share similar creation stories among them orkut google s social networking software google talk its instant message application google sky which allows astronomically inclined users to browse pictures of the universe and google translate its translation software for mobile devices as google engineer alec proudfoot whose own 20 percent project aimed at boosting the efficiency of hybrid cars put it in a television interview just about all the good ideas here at google have bubbled up from 20 percent time back at atlassian the experiment in 20 percent time seemed to work in what turned out to be a yearlong trial developers launched forty eight new projects so in 2009 cannon brookes decided to make this dose of task autonomy a permanent feature of atlassian work life the decision didn t sit well with everyone by cannon brookes s back of the blog calculations seventy engineers spending 20 percent of their time over just a six month period amounted to an investment of 1 million the company s chief financial officer was aghast some project managers despite atlassian s forward thinking ways the company still uses the m word weren t happy because it meant ceding some of their control over employees when a few wanted to track employees time to make sure they didn t abuse the privilege cannon brookes said no that was too controlling i wanted to back our engineers and take it on faith that they ll do good things besides he says people are way more efficient about 20 percent time than regular work time they say ôi m not going to expletive ing do anything like read newsfeeds or do facebook these days when a finance guy pearls of sweat rolling from his green eyeshades objects to the price tag cannon brookes has a ready response i show him a long list of things we ve delivered i show him that we have zero turnover in engineering and i show him that we have highly motivated engineers who are always trying to perfect and improve our product autonomy over task is one of the essential aspects of the motivation 3 0 approach to work and it isn t reserved only for technology companies at georgetown university hospital in washington d c for instance many nurses have the freedom to conduct their own research projects which in turn have changed a number of the hospital s programs and policies autonomy measures can work in a range of fields and offer a promising source for innovations and even institutional reforms initiatives like fedex days and sanctioned side projects aren t always easy to execute in the day to day maw of serving customers shipping products and solving problems but they re becoming urgent in an economy that demands nonroutine creative conceptual abilities as any artist or designer would agree autonomy over task has long been critical to their ability to create and good leaders as opposed to competent managers understand this in their bones case in point george nelson who was the design director at her man miller the iconic american furniture maker for a few decades he once laid down five simple tenets that he believed led to great design one of these principles could serve as a rallying cry for type i s ethic of autonomy over task you decide what you will make time ever wonder why lawyers as a group are so miserable some social scientists have and they ve offered three explanations one involves pessimism being pessimistic is almost always a recipe for low levels of what psychologists call subjective well being it s also a detriment in most professions but as martin seligman has written there is one glaring exception pessimists do better at law in other words an attitude that makes someone less happy as a human being actually makes her more effective as a lawyer a second reason most other enterprises are positive sum if i sell you something you want and enjoy we re both better off law by contrast is often though not always a zero sum game because somebody wins somebody else must lose but the third reason might offer the best explanation of all and help us understand why so few attorneys exemplify type i behavior lawyers often face intense demands but have relatively little decision latitude behavioral scientists use this term to describe the choices and perceived choices a person has in a sense it s another way of describing autonomy and lawyers are glum and cranky because they don t have much of it the deprivation starts early a 2007 study of two american law schools found that over the three year period in school students overall well being plummeted in large part because their need for autonomy was thwarted but students who had greater autonomy over their course selection their assignments and their relations with professors showed far less steep declines and actually posted better grades and bar exam scores nothing is more important to my success than controlling my schedule i m most creative from five to nine a m if i had a boss or co workers they would ruin my best hours one way or another scott adams dilbert creator alas at the heart of private legal practice is perhaps the most autonomy crushing mechanism imaginable the billable hour most lawyers and nearly all lawyers in large prestigious firms must keep scrupulous track often in six minute increments of their time if they fail to bill enough hours their jobs are in jeopardy as a result their focus inevitably veers from the output of their work solving a client s problem to its input piling up as many hours as possible if the rewards come from time then time is what firms will get these sorts of high stakes measurable goals can drain intrinsic motivation sap individual initiative and even encourage unethical behavior if one is expected to bill more than two thousand hours per year former u s supreme court chief justice william rehnquist once said there are bound to be temptations to exaggerate the hours actually put in the billable hour is a relic of motivation 2 0 it makes some sense for routine tasks whether fitting doors onto the body of a ford taurus or adding up deductions on a simple tax form because there s a tight connection between how much time goes in and how much work comes out and if your starting assumption is that workers default setting is to shirk monitoring their time can keep them on their toes but the billable hour has little place in motivation 3 0 for nonroutine tasks including law the link between how much time somebody spends and what that somebody produces is irregular and unpredictable imagine requiring inventor dean kamen or actress helen mirren to bill for their time if we begin from an alternative and more accurate presumption that people want to do good work then we ought to let them focus on the work itself rather than the time it takes them to do it already a few law firms are moving in this new more type i direction charging a flat rate rather than a time based fee with the presiding partner of one of new york s leading law firms recently declaring this is the time to get rid of the billable hour if the billable hour has an antithesis it s the results only work environment of the kind that jeff gunther has introduced at his companies the first large company to go rowe was best buy not in its stores but in its corporate offices like 3m s 15 percent time best buy s rowe experiment began as something of a rogue project launched by ressler and thompson whom i mentioned earlier and who have since become rowe gurus taking their message of autonomy around the world best buy s headquarters in richfield minnesota are airy modern and replete with a concierge cafžs and dry cleaner but the company had a reputation for punishing hours and intrusive bosses and it was paying the price in lost talent best buy s then ceo brad anderson quietly agreed to ressler and thompson s weird proposal because it encouraged people to contribute rather than just show up and grind out their days today best buy s headquarters has fewer people working a regular schedule than it has those working a rowe un schedule and even though retail electronics is a brutally competitive industry best buy has held its own both in the marketplace and in its quest for talent reporting on the company s rowe results in the harvard business review tamara erickson writes salaried people put in as much time as it takes to do their work hourly employees in the program work a set number of hours to comply with federal labor regulations but they get to choose when those employees report better relationships with family and friends more company loyalty and more focus and energy productivity has increased by 35 and voluntary turnover is 320 basis points lower than in teams that have not made the change employees say they don t know whether they work fewer hours they ve stopped counting without sovereignty over our time it s nearly impossible to have autonomy over our lives a few type i organizations have begun to recognize this truth about the human condition and to realign their practices more no doubt will follow in the past work was defined primarily by putting in time and secondarily on getting results we need to flip that model ressler told me no matter what kind of business you re in it s time to throw away the tardy slips time clocks and outdated industrial age thinking technique when you call a customer service line to complain about your cable television bill or to check the whereabouts of that blender you ordered the phone usually rings in a colorless cavern known as a call center the person who answers the call a customer service representative has a tough job he typically sits for hours among a warren of cramped cubicles headset strapped on a diet soda by his side the pay is paltry and the people the rep encounters on the phone one after another after another generally aren t ringing up to offer kudos or to ask about the rep s weekend plans they ve got a gripe a frustration or a problem that needs solving right now if that weren t trying enough call center reps have little decision latitude and their jobs are often the very definition of routine when a call comes in they listen to the caller and then in most cases tap a few buttons on their computer to retrieve a script then they follow that script sometimes word for word in the hope of getting the caller off the line as quickly as possible it can be deadening work made drearier still because managers in many call centers in an effort to boost productivity listen in on reps conversations and monitor how long each call lasts little wonder then that call centers in the united states and the uk have annual turnover rates that average about 35 percent double the rate for other jobs in some call centers the annual turnover rate exceeds 100 percent meaning that on average none of the people working there today will be there a year from now tony hsieh founder of the online shoe retailer now part of thought there was a better way to recruit prepare and challenge such employees so new hires at zappos go through a week of training then at the end of those seven days hsieh makes them an offer if they feel zappos isn t for them and want to leave he ll pay them 2 000 no hard feelings hsieh is hacking the motivation 2 0 operating system like a brilliant and benevolent teenage computer whiz he s using an if then reward not to motivate people to perform better but to weed out those who aren t fit for a motivation 3 0 style workplace the people who remain receive decent pay and just as important they have autonomy over technique zappos doesn t monitor its customer service employees call times or require them to use scripts the reps handle calls the way they want their job is to serve the customer well how they do it is up to them the results of this emphasis on autonomy over technique turnover at zappos is minimal and although it s still young zappos consistently ranks as one of the best companies for customer service in the united states ahead of better known names like cadillac bmw and apple and roughly equal to ritzy brands like jaguar and the ritz carlton not bad for a shoe company based in the nevada desert what zappos is doing is part of a small but growing move to restore some measure of individual freedom in jobs usually known for the lack of it for instance while many enterprises are offshoring work to low cost providers overseas some companies are reversing the trend by beginning what s known as homeshoring instead of requiring customer service reps to report to a single large call center they re routing the calls to the employees homes this cuts commuting time for staff removes them from physical monitoring and provides far greater autonomy over how they do their jobs the american airline jetblue was one of the first to try this approach from its launch in 2000 jetblue has relied on telephone customer service employees who work at home and from its launch jetblue has earned customer service rankings far ahead of its competitors productivity and job satisfaction are generally higher in homeshoring than in conventional arrangements in part because employees are more comfortable and less monitored at home but it s also because this autonomy centered approach draws from a deeper pool of talent many homeshore employees are parents students retirees and people with disabilities those who want to work but need to do it their own way according to one report between 70 and 80 percent of home based customer service agents have college degrees double the percentage among people working in traditional call centers ventures like alpine access phh arval and liveops which run customer service departments for a range of companies report that after adopting this method their recruiting costs fall to almost zero prospective employees come to them and now these home based customer service reps are working for a number of u s companies including 1 800 flowers j crew office depot even the internal revenue service handling customer inquiries the way they choose as in any effective motivation 3 0 workplace it s their call team whatever your place in the birth order consider what it s like to be the third child in a family you don t get a say in choosing the people around you they re there when you arrive worse one or two of them might not be so glad to see you and getting rid of even just one of them is usually impossible autonomy over what we do is most important the biggest difference between working for other studios and running my own has been the fact that i can choose what job we take on and what product service or institution we promote this i find the single most important question when i m close to the content research becomes easy meetings become interesting people who produce interesting products or services are mostly interesting themselves and i don t have to be involved in false advertising stefan sagmeisterdesigner taking a new job and holding most jobs are similar enterprising souls might be able to scratch out some autonomy over task time and technique but autonomy over team is a taller order that s one reason people are drawn to entrepreneurship the chance to build a team of their own but even in more traditional settings although far from typical yet a few organizations are discovering the virtues of offering people some amount of freedom over those with whom they work for example at the organic grocery chain whole foods the people who are nominally in charge of each department don t do the hiring that task falls to a department s employees after a job candidate has worked a thirty day trial period on a team the prospective teammates vote on whether to hire that person full time at w l gore associates the makers of the gore tex fabric and another example of motivation 3 0 in action anybody who wants to rise in the ranks and lead a team must assemble people willing to work with her the ability to put together a pick up basketball team of company talent is another attraction of 20 percent time these initiatives usually slice across the organization chart connecting people who share an interest if not a department as google engineer bharat mediratta told the new york times if your 20 percent idea is a new product it s usually pretty easy to just find a few like minded people and start coding away and when pushing for a more systemic change in the organization mediratta says autonomy over team is even more important those efforts require what he calls a grouplet a small self organized team that has almost no budget and even less authority but that tries to change something within the company for instance mediratta formed a testing grouplet to encourage engineers throughout the company to implement a more efficient way to test computer code this informal band of coders a team built autonomously without direction from the top slowly turned the organization on its axis still the desire for autonomy can often collide with other obligations one surprise as atlassian ran the numbers on its task autonomy experiment was that most employees came in substantially under the 20 percent figure the main reason they didn t want to let down their current teammates by abandoning ongoing projects although autonomy over team is the least developed of the four t s the ever escalating power of social networks and the rise of mobile apps now make this brand of autonomy easier to achieve and in ways that reach beyond a single organization the open source projects i mentioned in chapter 1 in which ad hoc teams self assemble to build a new browser or create better server software are a potent example and once again the science affirms the value of something traditional businesses have been slow to embrace ample research has shown that people working in self organized teams are more satisfied than those working in inherited teams likewise studies by deci and others have shown that people high in intrinsic motivation are better coworkers and that makes the possibilities on this front enormous if you want to work with more type i s the best strategy is to become one yourself autonomy it turns out can be contagious the art of autonomy think for a moment about the great artists of the last hundred years and how they worked people like pablo picasso georgia o keeffe and jackson pollock unlike for the rest of us motivation 2 0 was never their operating system nobody told them you must paint this sort of picture you must begin painting precisely at eight thirty a m you must paint with the people we select to work with you and you must paint this way the very idea is ludicrous but you know what it s ludicrous for you too whether you re fixing sinks ringing up groceries selling cars or writing a lesson plan you and i need autonomy just as deeply as a great painter however encouraging autonomy doesn t mean discouraging accountability whatever operating system is in place people must be accountable for their work but there are different ways to achieve this end each built on different assumptions about who we are deep down motivation 2 0 assumed that if people had freedom they would shirk and that autonomy was a way to bypass accountability motivation 3 0 begins with a different assumption it presumes that people want to be accountable and that making sure they have control over their task their time their technique and their team is a pathway to that destination of course because most workplaces still reverberate with the assumptions of the old operating system transitioning to autonomy won t often can t happen in one fell swoop if we pluck people out of controlling environments when they ve known nothing else and plop them in a rowe or an environment of undiluted autonomy they ll struggle organizations must provide as richard ryan puts it scaffolding to help every employee find his footing to make the transition what s more different individuals will prize different aspects of autonomy some might crave autonomy over a task others might prefer autonomy over the team as zappos ceo hsieh told me by e mail studies have shown that perceived control is an important component of one s happiness however what people feel like they want control over really varies so i don t think there s one aspect of autonomy that s universally the most important different individuals have different desires so the best strategy for an employer would be to figure out what s important to each individual employee still however those individual desires express themselves on the surface they grow from common roots we re born to be players not pawns we re meant to be autonomous individuals not individual automatons we re designed to be type i but outside forces including the very idea that we need to be managed have conspired to change our default setting and turn us into type x if we update the environments we re in not only at work but also at school and at home and if leaders recognize both the truth of the human condition and the science that supports it we can return ourselves and our colleagues to our natural state the course of human history has always moved in the direction of greater freedom and there s a reason for that because it s in our nature to push for it ryan told me if we were just plastic like some people think this wouldn t be happening but somebody stands in front of a tank in china women who ve been denied autonomy keep advocating for rights this is the course of history this is why ultimately human nature if it ever realizes itself will do so by becoming more autonomous drive chapter 5 mastery you need not see what someone is doing to know if it is his vocation you have only to watch his eyes a cook mixing a sauce a surgeon making a primary incision a clerk completing a bill of lading wear the same rapt expression forgetting themselves in a function how beautiful it is that eye on the object look w h auden o ne summer morning in 1944 mihaly csikszentmihalyi age ten stood on a train platform in budapest hungary with his mother two brothers and about seventy relatives who d come to see them off world war ii was raging and hungary an ambivalent member of the axis was being squeezed from every political and geographic corner nazi soldiers were occupying the country in retaliation for hungary s secret peace negotiations with the united states and great britain meanwhile soviet troops were advancing on the capital city it was time to leave so the foursome boarded a train for venice italy where csikszentmihalyi s father a diplomat was working as the train rumbled southwest bombs exploded in the distance bullets ripped through the train s windows while a rifle toting soldier on board fired back at the attackers the ten year old crouched under his seat terrified but also a little annoyed it struck me at that point that grown ups had really no idea how to live csikszentmihalyi told me some sixty five years later his train would turn out to be the last to cross the danube river for many years shortly after its departure air strikes destroyed hungary s major bridges the csikszentmihalyis were well educated and well connected but the war flattened their lives of the relatives on the train platform that morning more than half would be dead five months later one of csikszentmihalyi s brothers spent six years doing hard labor in the ural mountains another was killed fighting the soviets the whole experience got me thinking csikszentmihalyi said recalling his ten year old self there has got to be a better way to live than this from compliance to engagement t he opposite of autonomy is control and since they sit at different poles of the behavioral compass they point us toward different destinations control leads to compliance autonomy leads to engagement and this distinction leads to the second element of type i behavior mastery the desire to get better and better at something that matters as i explained in part one motivation 2 0 s goal was to encourage people to do particular things in particular ways that is to get them to comply and for that objective few motivators are more effective than a nice bunch of carrots and the threat of an occasional stick this was rarely a promising route to self actualization of course but as an economic strategy it had a certain logic for routine tasks the sort of work that defined most of the twentieth century gaining compliance usually worked just fine but that was then for the definitional tasks of the twenty first century such a strategy falls short often woefully short solving complex problems requires an inquiring mind and the willingness to experiment one s way to a fresh solution where motivation 2 0 sought compliance motivation 3 0 seeks engagement only engagement can produce mastery and the pursuit of mastery an important but often dormant part of our third drive has become essential in making one s way in today s economy unfortunately despite sweet smelling words like empowerment that waft through corporate corridors the modern workplace s most notable feature may be its lack of engagement and its disregard for mastery gallup s extensive research on the subject shows that in the united states more than 50 percent of employees are not engaged at work and nearly 20 percent are actively disengaged the cost of all this disengagement about 300 billion a year in lost productivity a sum larger than the gdp of portugal singapore or israel yet in comparative terms the united states looks like a veritable haven of type i behavior at work according to the consulting firm mckinsey co in some countries as little as 2 to 3 percent of the workforce is highly engaged in their work equally important engagement as a route to mastery is a powerful force in our personal lives while complying can be an effective strategy for physical survival it s a lousy one for personal fulfillment living a satisfying life requires more than simply meeting the demands of those in control yet in our offices and our classrooms we have way too much compliance and way too little engagement the former might get you through the day but only the latter will get you through the night and that brings us back to csikszentmihalyi s story in his early teens after witnessing the atrocities of nazi germany and the soviet takeover of his country csikszentmihalyi was understandably weary of compliance and looking for engagement but he wouldn t find it at school he dropped out of high school at thirteen for nearly a decade he worked in various western european countries at a series of jobs some odder than others to support himself and hoping to answer his youthful question about a better way to live he read everything he could get his hands on in religion and philosophy what he learned didn t satisfy him it wasn t until he inadvertently stumbled into a lecture by none other than carl jung that he heard about the field of psychology and decided that it might hold the secrets he sought so in 1956 at the age of twenty two csikszentmihalyi set off for the united states to study psychology he arrived in chicago a high school dropout with 1 25 in his pocket whose only familiarity with the english language came from reading pogo comic strips hungarian contacts in chicago helped him find a job and a place to live his knowledge of latin german and pogo helped him pass the illinois high school equivalency test in a language he neither spoke nor read he enrolled in the university of illinois chicago took classes during the day worked as a hotel auditor at night and eventually wound up at the university of chicago psychology department where just nine years after setting foot in america he earned a ph d but csikszentmihalyi resisted rafting down the main currents of his field as he told me one spring morning not long ago he wanted to explore the positive innovative creative approach to life instead of the remedial pathological view that sigmund freud had or the mechanistic work of b f skinner and others who reduced behavior to simple stimulus and response he began by writing about creativity creativity took him into the study of play and his exploration of play unlocked an insight about the human experience that would make him famous in the midst of play many people enjoyed what csikszentmihalyi called autotelic experiences from the greek auto self and telos goal or purpose in an autotelic experience the goal is self fulfilling the activity is its own reward painters he observed during his ph d research csikszentmihalyi said were so enthralled in what they were doing that they seemed to be in a trance for them time passed quickly and self consciousness dissolved he sought out other people who gravitated to these sorts of pursuits rock climbers soccer players swimmers spelunkers and interviewed them to discover what made an activity autotelic it was frustrating when people try to recall how it felt to climb a mountain or play a great musical piece csikszentmihalyi later wrote their stories are usually quite stereotyped and uninsightful he needed a way to probe people s experiences in the moment and in the mid 1970s a bold new technology one that any twelve year old now would find laughingly retrograde came to the rescue the electronic pager csikszentmihalyi who by then was teaching at the university of chicago and running his own psychology lab clipped on a pager and asked his graduate students to beep him randomly several times each day whenever the pager sounded he recorded what he was doing and how he was feeling it was so much fun he recalled in his office at the claremont graduate university in southern california where he now teaches you got such a detailed picture of how people lived on the basis of this test run he developed a methodology called the experience sampling method csikszentmihalyi would page people eight times a day at random intervals and ask them to write in a booklet their answers to several short questions about what they were doing who they were with and how they d describe their state of mind put the findings together for seven days and you had a flip book a mini movie of someone s week assemble the individual findings and you had an entire library of human experiences throughout my athletics career the overall goal was always to be a better athlete than i was at that moment whether next week next month or next year the improvement was the goal the medal was simply the ultimate reward for achieving that goal sebastian coemiddle distance runnerand two time olympicgold medal winner from these results csikszentmihalyi began to peel back the layers of those autotelic experiences perhaps equally significant he replaced that wonky greek derived adjective with a word he found people using to describe these optimal moments flow the highest most satisfying experiences in people s lives were when they were in flow and this previously unacknowledged mental state which seemed so inscrutable and transcendent was actually fairly easy to unpack in flow goals are clear you have to reach the top of the mountain hit the ball across the net or mold the clay just right feedback is immediate the mountaintop gets closer or farther the ball sails in or out of bounds the pot you re throwing comes out smooth or uneven most important in flow the relationship between what a person had to do and what he could do was perfect the challenge wasn t too easy nor was it too difficult it was a notch or two beyond his current abilities which stretched the body and mind in a way that made the effort itself the most delicious reward that balance produced a degree of focus and satisfaction that easily surpassed other more quotidian experiences in flow people lived so deeply in the moment and felt so utterly in control that their sense of time place and even self melted away they were autonomous of course but more than that they were engaged they were as the poet w h auden wrote forgetting themselves in a function maybe this state of mind was what that ten year old boy was seeking as that train rolled through europe maybe reaching flow not for a single moment but as an ethic for living maintaining that beautiful eye on the object look to achieve mastery as a cook a surgeon or a clerk was the answer maybe this was the way to live goldilocks on a cargo ship several years ago he can t recall exactly when csikszentmihalyi was invited to davos switzerland by klaus schwab who runs an annual conclave of the global power elite in that city joining him on the trip were three other university of chicago faculty members gary becker george stigler and milton friedman all of them economists all of them winners of the nobel prize the five men gathered for dinner one night and at the end of the meal schwab asked the academics what they considered the most important issue in modern economics the desire to do something because you find it deeply satisfying and personally challenging inspires the highest levels of creativity whether it s in the arts sciences or business teresa amabileprofessor harvard university to my incredulous surprise csikszentmihalyi recounted becker stigler and friedman all ended up saying a variation of ôthere s something missing that for all its explanatory power economics still failed to offer a rich enough account of behavior even in business settings csikszentmihalyi smiled and complimented his colleagues on their perspicacity the concept of flow which he introduced in the mid 1970s was not an immediate game changer it gained some traction in 1990 when csikszentmihalyi wrote his first book on the topic for a wide audience and gained a small band of followers in the business world however putting this notion into place in the real operations of real organizations has been slower going after all motivation 2 0 has little room for a concept like flow the type x operating system doesn t oppose people taking on optimal challenges on the job but it suggests that such moments are happy accidents rather than necessary conditions for people to do great work but ever so slowly the ground might be shifting as the data on worker disengagement earlier in the chapter reveal the costs in both human satisfaction and organizational health are high when a workplace is a no flow zone that s why a few enterprises are trying to do things differently as fast company magazine has noted a number of companies including microsoft patagonia and toyota have realized that creating flow friendly environments that help people move toward mastery can increase productivity and satisfaction at work for example stefan falk a vice president at ericsson the swedish telecommunications concern used the principles of flow to smooth a merger of the company s business units he persuaded managers to configure work assignments so that employees had clear objectives and a way to get quick feedback and instead of meeting with their charges for once a year performance reviews managers sat down with employees one on one six times a year often for as long as ninety minutes to discuss their level of engagement and path toward mastery the flow centered strategy worked well enough that ericsson began using it in offices around the world after that falk moved to green cargo an enormous logistics and shipping company in sweden there he developed a method of training managers in how flow worked then he required them to meet with staff once a month to get a sense of whether people were overwhelmed or underwhelmed with their work and to adjust assignments to help them find flow after two years of managerial revamping state owned green cargo became profitable for the first time in 125 years and executives cite its newfound flowcentricity as a key reason in addition a study of 11 000 industrial scientists and engineers working at companies in the united states found that the desire for intellectual challenge that is the urge to master something new and engaging was the best predictor of productivity scientists motivated by this intrinsic desire filed significantly more patents than those whose main motivation was money even controlling for the amount of effort each group expended that is the extrinsically motivated group worked as long and as hard as their more type i colleagues they just accomplished less perhaps because they spent less of their work time in flow and then there s jenova chen a young game designer who in 2006 wrote his mfa thesis on csikszentmihalyi s theory chen believed that video games held the promise to deliver quintessential flow experiences but that too many games required an almost obsessive level of commitment why not he thought design a game to bring the flow sensation to more casual gamers using his thesis project as his laboratory chen created a game in which players use a computer mouse to guide an on screen amoeba like organism through a surreal ocean landscape as it gobblies other creatures and slowly evolves into a higher form while most games require players to proceed through a fixed and predetermined series of skill levels chen s allows them to advance and explore any way they desire and unlike games in which failure ends the session in chen s game failure merely pushes the player to a level better matched to her ability chen calls his game flow and it s been a huge hit people have played the free online version of the game more than three million times you can find it at the paid version designed for the playstation game console has generated more than 350 000 downloads and collected a shelf full of awards chen used the game to launch his own firm thatgamecompany built around both flow and flow that quickly won a three game development deal from sony something almost unheard of for an unknown start up run by a couple of twenty six year old california game designers green cargo thatgamecompany and the companies employing the patent cranking scientists typically use two tactics that their less savvy competitors do not first they provide employees with what i call goldilocks tasks challenges that are not too hot and not too cold neither overly difficult nor overly simple one source of frustration in the workplace is the frequent mismatch between what people must do and what people can do when what they must do exceeds their capabilities the result is anxiety when what they must do falls short of their capabilities the result is boredom indeed csikszentmihalyi titled his first book on autotelic experiences beyond boredom and anxiety but when the match is just right the results can be glorious this is the essence of flow goldilocks tasks offer us the powerful experience of inhabiting the zone of living on the knife s edge between order and disorder of as painter fritz scholder once described it walking the tightrope between accident and discipline the second tactic that smart organizations use to increase their flow friendliness and their employees opportunities for mastery is to trigger the positive side of the sawyer effect recall from chapter 2 that extrinsic rewards can turn play into work but it s also possible to run the current in the other direction and turn work into play some tasks at work don t automatically provide surges of flow yet still need to get done so the shrewdest enterprises afford employees the freedom to sculpt their jobs in ways that bring a little bit of flow to otherwise mundane duties amy wrzesniewski and jane dutton two business school professors have studied this phenomenon among hospital cleaners nurses and hairdressers they found for instance that some members of the cleaning staff at hospitals instead of doing the minimum the job required took on new tasks from chatting with patients to helping make nurses jobs go more smoothly adding these more absorbing challenges increased these cleaners satisfaction and boosted their own views of their skills by reframing aspects of their duties they helped make work more playful and more fully their own even in low autonomy jobs wrzesniewski and dutton write employees can create new domains for mastery the three laws of mastery flow is essential to mastery but flow doesn t guarantee mastery because the two concepts operate on different horizons of time one happens in a moment the other unfolds over months years sometimes decades you and i each might reach flow tomorrow morning but neither one of us will achieve mastery overnight so how can we enlist flow in the quest for something that goes deeper and endures longer what can we do to move toward mastery one of the key elements of type i behavior in our organizations and our lives a few behavioral scientists have offered some initial answers to those questions and their findings suggest that mastery abides by three somewhat peculiar laws mastery is a mindset as with so many things in life the pursuit of mastery is all in our head at least that s what carol dweck has discovered dweck a psychology professor at stanford university has been studying motivation and achievement in children and young adults for nearly forty years amassing a body of rigorous empirical research that has made her a superstar in contemporary behavioral science dweck s signature insight is that what people believe shapes what people achieve our beliefs about ourselves and the nature of our abilities what she calls our self theories determine how we interpret our experiences and can set the boundaries on what we accomplish although her research looks mostly at notions of intelligence her findings apply with equal force to most human capabilities and they yield the first law of mastery mastery is a mindset according to dweck people can hold two different views of their own intelligence those who have an entity theory believe that intelligence is just that an entity it exists within us in a finite supply that we cannot increase those who subscribe to an incremental theory take a different view they believe that while intelligence may vary slightly from person to person it is ultimately something that with effort we can increase to analogize to physical qualities incremental theorists consider intelligence as something like strength want to get stronger and more muscular start pumping iron entity theorists view it as something more like height want to get taller you re out of luck if you believe intelligence is a fixed quantity then every educational and professional encounter becomes a measure of how much you have if you believe intelligence is something you can increase then the same encounters become opportunities for growth in one view intelligence is something you demonstrate in the other it s something you develop figure out for yourself what you want to be really good at know that you ll never really satisfy yourself that you ve made it and accept that that s okay robert b reichformer u s secretary of labor the two self theories lead down two very different paths one that heads toward mastery and one that doesn t for instance consider goals dweck says they come in two varieties performance goals and learning goals getting an a in french class is a performance goal being able to speak french is a learning goal both goals are entirely normal and pretty much universal dweck says and both can fuel achievement but only one leads to mastery in several studies dweck found that giving children a performance goal say getting a high mark on a test was effective for relatively straightforward problems but often inhibited children s ability to apply the concepts to new situations for example in one study dweck and a colleague asked junior high students to learn a set of scientific principles giving half of the students a performance goal and half a learning goal after both groups demonstrated they had grasped the material researchers asked the students to apply their knowledge to a new set of problems related but not identical to what they d just studied students with learning goals scored significantly higher on these novel challenges they also worked longer and tried more solutions as dweck writes with a learning goal students don t have to feel that they re already good at something in order to hang in and keep trying after all their goal is to learn not to prove they re smart indeed the two self theories take very different views of effort to incremental theorists exertion is positive since incremental theorists believe that ability is malleable they see working harder as a way to get better by contrast says dweck the entity theory is a system that requires a diet of easy successes in this schema if you have to work hard it means you re not very good people therefore choose easy targets that when hit affirm their existing abilities but do little to expand them in a sense entity theorists want to look like masters without expending the effort to attain mastery finally the two types of thinking trigger contrasting responses to adversity one that dweck calls helpless the other mastery oriented in a study of american fifth and sixth graders dweck gave students eight conceptual problems they could solve followed by four they could not because the questions were too advanced for children that age students who subscribed to the idea that brain power is fixed gave up quickly on the tough problems and blamed their lack of intelligence for their difficulties students with a more expansive mindset kept working in spite of the difficulty and deployed far more inventive strategies to find a solution what did these students blame for their inability to conquer the toughest problems the answer which surprised us was that they didn t blame anything dweck says the young people recognized that setbacks were inevitable on the road to mastery and that they could even be guideposts for the journey dweck s insights map nicely to the behavioral distinctions underlying motivation 2 0 and motivation 3 0 type x behavior often holds an entity theory of intelligence prefers performance goals to learning goals and disdains effort as a sign of weakness type i behavior has an incremental theory of intelligence prizes learning goals over performance goals and welcomes effort as a way to improve at something that matters begin with one mindset and mastery is impossible begin with the other and it can be inevitable mastery is a pain each summer about twelve hundred young american men and women arrive at the united states military academy at west point to begin four years of study and to take their place in the fabled long gray line but before any of them sees a classroom they go through seven weeks of cadet basic training otherwise known as beast barracks by the time the summer ends one in twenty of these talented dedicated young adults has dropped out a group of scholars two from west point another from the university of pennsylvania and a fourth from the university of michigan wanted to understand why some students continued on the road toward military mastery and others got off at the first exit try to pick a profession in which you enjoy even the most mundane tedious parts then you will always be happy will shortzpuzzle guru was it physical strength and athleticism intellect leadership ability well roundedness none of the above the best predictor of success the researchers found was the prospective cadets ratings on a noncognitive non physical trait known as grit defined as perseverance and passion for long term goals the experience of these army officers in training confirms the second law of mastery mastery is a pain as wonderful as flow is the path to mastery becoming ever better at something you care about is not lined with daisies and spanned by a rainbow if it were more of us would make the trip mastery hurts sometimes many times it s not much fun that is one lesson of the work of psychologist anders ericsson whose groundbreaking research on expert performance has provided a new theory of what fosters mastery as he puts it many characteristics once believed to reflect innate talent are actually the results of intense practice for a minimum of 10 years mastery of sports music business requires effort difficult painful excruciating all consuming effort over a long time not a week or a month but a decade sociologist daniel chambliss has referred to this as the mundanity of excellence like ericsson chambliss found in a three year study of olympic swimmers that those who did the best typically spent the most time and effort on the mundane activities that readied them for races it s the same reason that in another study the west point grit researchers found that grittiness rather than iq or standardized test scores is the most accurate predictor of college grades as they explained whereas the importance of working harder is easily apprehended the importance of working longer without switching objectives may be less perceptible in every field grit may be as essential as talent to high accomplishment flow enters the picture here in two ways if people are conscious of what puts them in flow they ll have a clearer idea of what they should devote the time and dedication to master and those moments of flow in the course of pursuing excellence can help people through the rough parts but in the end mastery often involves working and working and showing little improvement perhaps with a few moments of flow pulling you along then making a little progress and then working and working on that new slightly higher plateau again it s grueling to be sure but that s not the problem that s the solution as carol dweck says effort is one of the things that gives meaning to life effort means you care about something that something is important to you and you are willing to work for it it would be an impoverished existence if you were not willing to value things and commit yourself to working toward them another doctor one who lacks a ph d but has a plaque in the basketball hall of fame in springfield massachusetts put it similarly being a professional julius erving once said is doing the things you love to do on the days you don t feel like doing them mastery is an asymptote to understand the final law of mastery you need to know a little algebra and a little art history from algebra you might remember the concept of an asymptote if not maybe you ll recognize it below an asymptote in this case a horizontal asymptote is a straight line that a curve approaches but never quite reaches from art history you might remember paul cžzanne the nineteenth century french painter you needn t remember much just that he was significant enough to have art critics and scholars write about him cžzanne s most enduring paintings came late in his life and one reason for this according to university of chicago economist david galenson who s studied the careers of artists is that he was endlessly trying to realize his best work for cžzanne one critic wrote the ultimate synthesis of a design was never revealed in a flash rather he approached it with infinite precautions stalking it as it were now from one point of view now from another for him the synthesis was an asymptote toward which he was for ever approaching without ever quite reaching it this is the nature of mastery mastery is an asymptote you can approach it you can home in on it you can get really really really close to it but like cžzanne you can never touch it mastery is impossible to realize fully tiger woods perhaps the greatest golfer of all time has said flatly that he can that he must become better he said it when he was an amateur he ll say it after his best outing or at the end of his finest season he s pursuing mastery that s well known what s less well known is that he understands that he ll never get it it will always hover beyond his grasp the mastery asymptote is a source of frustration why reach for something you can never fully attain but it s also a source of allure why not reach for it the joy is in the pursuit more than the realization in the end mastery attracts precisely because mastery eludes the oxygen of the soul the subjects were displaying the warning signs of generalized anxiety disorder a mental illness that afflicts roughly 3 percent of the adult population according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm iv the presence of any three of the following six symptoms indicates what could be a serious problem restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge being easily fatigued difficulty concentrating or mind going blank irritability muscle tension sleep disturbance these men and women seemed textbook cases one person who had previously glided through life with equanimity now felt tense more hostile angry and irritated another reported being more irritable restless and suffering from shorter concentration yet another scribbled this self description slept badly listless more nervous more guarded some people feared they were having a nervous breakdown one person s mind was so muddied that he inadvertently walked into a wall and broke his glasses time for a trip to the psychiatrist or a prescription for antianxiety medicine no it was time for people to let flow back into their lives in the early 1970s csikszentmihalyi conducted an experiment in which he asked people to record all the things they did in their lives that were noninstrumental that is small activities they undertook not out of obligation or to achieve a particular objective but because they enjoyed them then he issued the following set of instructions beginning morning of target date when you wake up and until 9 00 pm we would like you to act in a normal way doing all the things you have to do but not doing anything that is play or noninstrumental in other words he and his research team directed participants to scrub their lives of flow people who liked aspects of their work had to avoid situations that might trigger enjoyment people who relished demanding physical exercise had to remain sedentary one woman enjoyed washing dishes because it gave her something constructive to do along with time to fantasize free of guilt but could wash dishes only when absolutely necessary the results were almost immediate even at the end of the first day participants noticed an increased sluggishness about their behavior they began complaining of headaches most reported difficulty concentrating with thoughts that wander round in circles without getting anywhere some felt sleepy while others were too agitated to sleep as csikszentmihalyi wrote after just two days of deprivation the general deterioration in mood was so advanced that prolonging the experiment would have been unadvisable two days forty eight hours without flow plunged people into a state eerily similar to a serious psychiatric disorder the experiment suggests that flow the deep sense of engagement that motivation 3 0 calls for isn t a nicety it s a necessity we need it to survive it is the oxygen of the soul and one of csikszentmihalyi s more surprising findings is that people are much more likely to reach that flow state at work than in leisure work can often have the structure of other autotelic experiences clear goals immediate feedback challenges well matched to our abilities and when it does we don t just enjoy it more we do it better that s why it s so odd that organizations tolerate work environments that deprive large numbers of people of these experiences by offering a few more goldilocks tasks by looking for ways to unleash the positive side of the sawyer effect organizations can help their own cause and enrich people s lives csikszentmihalyi grasped this essential reality more than thirty years ago when he wrote there is no reason to believe any longer that only irrelevant ôplay can be enjoyed while the serious business of life must be borne as a burdensome cross once we realize that the boundaries between work and play are artificial we can take matters in hand and begin the difficult task of making life more livable but if we re looking for guidance on how to do this right on how to make mastery an ethic for living our best role models are probably not sitting around a boardroom table or working in the office down the hall over lunch csikszentmihalyi and i talked about children a little kid s life bursts with autotelic experiences children careen from one flow moment to another animated by a sense of joy equipped with a mindset of possibility and working with the dedication of a west point cadet they use their brains and their bodies to probe and draw feedback from the environment in an endless pursuit of mastery then at some point in their lives they don t what happens you start to get ashamed that what you re doing is childish csikszentmihalyi explained what a mistake perhaps you and i and all the other adults in charge of things are the ones who are immature it goes back to csikszentmihalyi s experience on the train wondering how grown ups could have gotten things so wrong our circumstances may be less dire but the observation is no less acute left to their own devices csikszentmihalyi says children seek out flow with the inevitability of a natural law so should we all drive chapter 6 purpose w e know from statisticians that demographics is destiny and we know from the rolling stones that you can t always get what you want what we don t know is what happens when these two indomitable principles sit down pour themselves a drink and get to know each other better but we re about to find out in 2006 the first members of the baby boom generation began turning sixty on birthdays with big round numbers people usually stop reflect and take stock of their lives and i ve found that when boomers in the united states and elsewhere reach this milestone they typically move through a three stage reaction in the first stage they ask how the heck did i get to be sixty when their odometer flips to 6 0 people often are surprised and slightly alarmed sixty they think is old they tally their regrets and confront the reality that mick jagger and crew were right that they didn t always get what they wanted but then the second stage kicks in in the not so distant past turning sixty meant that you were somewhat ahem long in the tooth but at the beginning of the twenty first century anyone who s healthy enough to have made it six decades is probably healthy enough to hang on a fair bit longer according to united nations data a sixty year old american man can expect to live for another twenty plus years a sixty year old american woman will be around for another quarter of a century in japan a sixty year old man can expect to live past his eighty second birthday a sixty year old woman to nearly eighty eight the pattern is the same in many other prosperous countries in france israel italy switzerland canada and elsewhere if you ve reached the age of sixty you re more than likely to live into your eighties and this realization brings with it a certain relief whew the boomer in toronto or osaka sighs i ve got a couple more decades but the relief quickly dissipates because almost as soon as the sigh fades people enter the third stage upon comprehending that they could have another twenty five years sixty year old boomers look back twenty five years to when they were thirty five and a sudden thought clonks them on the side of the head wow that sure happened fast they say will the next twenty five years race by like that if so when am i going to do something that matters when am i going to live my best life when am i going to make a difference in the world those questions which swirl through conversations taking place at boomer kitchen tables around the world may sound touchy feely but they re now occurring at a rate that is unprecedented in human civilization consider boomers are the largest demographic cohort in most western countries as well as in places like japan australia and new zealand according to the u s census bureau the united states alone has about 78 million boomers which means that on average each year more than four million americans hit this soul searching life pondering birthday that s more than 11 000 people each day more than 450 every hour in other words in america alone one hundred boomers turn sixty every thirteen minutes every thirteen minutes another hundred people members of the wealthiest and best educated generation the world has ever known begin reckoning with their mortality and asking deep questions about meaning significance and what they truly want one hundred people every thirteen minutes every hour of every day until 2024 when the cold front of demographics meets the warm front of unrealized dreams the result will be a thunderstorm of purpose the likes of which the world has never seen the purpose motive the first two legs of the type i tripod autonomy and mastery are essential but for proper balance we need a third leg purpose which provides a context for its two mates autonomous people working toward mastery perform at very high levels but those who do so in the service of some greater objective can achieve even more the most deeply motivated people not to mention those who are most productive and satisfied hitch their desires to a cause larger than themselves motivation 2 0 however doesn t recognize purpose as a motivator the type x operating system doesn t banish the concept but it relegates it to the status of ornament a nice accessory if you want it so long as it doesn t get in the way of the important stuff yet by taking this view motivation 2 0 neglects a crucial part of who we are from the moment that human beings first stared into the sky contemplated their place in the universe and tried to create something that bettered the world and outlasted their lives we have been purpose seekers purpose provides activation energy for living psychologist mihaly csikszentmihalyi told me in an interview i think that evolution has had a hand in selecting people who had a sense of doing something beyond themselves i believe wholeheartedly that a new form of capitalism is emerging more stakeholders customers employees shareholders and the larger community want their businesses to have a purpose bigger than their product mats lederhauseninvestor and formermcdonald s executive motivation 3 0 seeks to reclaim this aspect of the human condition baby boomers around the world because of the stage of their lives and the size of their numbers are nudging purpose closer to the cultural center in response business has begun to rethink how purpose figures in what it does as an emotional catalyst wealth maximization lacks the power to fully mobilize human energies says strategy guru and boomer gary hamel those staggering levels of worker disengagement i described in the previous chapter have a companion trend that companies are only starting to recognize an equally sharp rise in volunteerism especially in the united states these diverging lines compensated engagement going down uncompensated effort going up suggest that volunteer work is nourishing people in ways that paid work simply is not we re learning that the profit motive potent though it is can be an insufficient impetus for both individuals and organizations an equally powerful source of energy one we ve often neglected or dismissed as unrealistic is what we might call the purpose motive this is the final big distinction between the two operating systems motivation 2 0 centered on profit maximization motivation 3 0 doesn t reject profits but it places equal emphasis on purpose maximization we see the first stirrings of this new purpose motive in three realms of organizational life goals words and policies in a curious way age is simpler than youth for it has so many fewer options stanley kunitzformer u s poet laureate goals boomers aren t singing alone in their chorus of purpose joining them and using the same hymnbook are their sons and daughters known as generation y the millennials or the echo boomers these young adults who have recently begun entering the workforce themselves are shifting the center of gravity in organizations by their very presence as the writer sylvia hewlett has found in her research the two bookend generations are redefining success and are willing to accept a radically ôremixed set of rewards neither generation rates money as the most important form of compensation instead they choose a range of nonmonetary factors from a great team to the ability to give back to society through work and if they can t find that satisfying package of rewards in an existing organization they ll create a venture of their own take the case of american gen y er blake mycoskie and toms shoes the company he launched in 2006 toms doesn t fit snugly into the traditional business boxes it offers hip canvas flat soled shoes but every time toms sells a pair of shoes to you me or your next door neighbor it gives away another pair of new shoes to a child in a developing country is toms a charity that finances its operation with shoe sales or is it a business that sacrifices its earnings in order to do good it s neither and it s both the answer is so confusing in fact that toms shoes had to address the question directly on its website just below information on how to return a pair that s too big toms the site explains is a for profit company with giving at its core got it no okay try this the company s business model transforms our customers into benefactors better maybe weirder certainly ventures like toms blur perhaps even shatter the existing categories their goals and the way companies reach them are so incompatible to motivation 2 0 that if toms had to rely on this twentieth century operating system the whole endeavor would seize up and crash in the entrepreneurial equivalent of a blue screen of death motivation 3 0 by contrast is expressly built for purpose maximization in fact the rise of purpose maximizers is one reason we need the new operating system in the first place as i explained in chapter 1 operations like toms are on the vanguard of a broader rethinking of how people organize what they do for benefit organizations b corporations and low profit limited liability corporations all recast the goals of the traditional business enterprise and all are becoming more prevalent as a new breed of businessperson seeks purpose with the fervor that traditional economic theory says entrepreneurs seek profit even cooperatives an older business model with motives other than profit maximization are moving from the shaggy edge to the clean cut center according to writer marjorie kelly in the last three decades worldwide membership in co ops has doubled to 800 million people in the united states alone more people belong to a co op than own shares in the stock market and the idea is spreading in colombia kelly notes saludcoop provides health care services to a quarter of the population in spain the mondrag n corporaci n cooperativa is the nation s seventh largest industrial concern these not only for profit enterprises are a far cry from the socially responsible businesses that have been all the rage for the last fifteen years but have rarely delivered on their promise the aims of these motivation 3 0 companies are not to chase profit while trying to stay ethical and law abiding their goal is to pursue purpose and to use profit as the catalyst rather than the objective words in the spring of 2009 as the world economy was reeling from a once in a generation crisis and the financial shenanigans that stoked it a few harvard business school students glanced in the mirror and wondered if they were the problem the people they d aspired to be financiers and corporate dealmakers weren t it turned out heroes in an epic tale but villains in a darker story many of these high profile businesspeople were the ones who pushed the financial system to the brink meanwhile these young men and women looked among their classmates and saw the seeds of similar behavior in one survey of mba students a few years earlier a whopping 56 percent admitted to cheating regularly so a handful of harvard second years fearing that what was once a badge of honor had become three scarlet letters did what business students are trained to do they made a plan together they fashioned what they called the mba oath a hippocratic oath for business grads in which they pledge their fealty to causes above and beyond the bottom line it s not a legal document it s a code of conduct and the conduct it recommends as well as the very words it uses leans more toward purpose maximization than profit maximization from the first sentence the oath rings with the sounds of motivation 3 0 as a manager my purpose is to serve the greater good by bringing people and resources together to create value that no single individual can create alone it begins and on it goes for nearly five hundred words i will safeguard the interests of my shareholders co workers customers and the society in which we operate the oath takers pledge i will strive to create sustainable economic social and environmental prosperity worldwide these words purpose greater good sustainable don t come from the type x dictionary one rarely hears them in business school because after all that s not what business school is supposed to be about yet students at arguably the world s most powerful mba factory thought otherwise and in just a few weeks roughly one quarter of the graduating class had taken the oath and signed the pledge in launching the effort max anderson one of the student founders said my hope is that at our 25th reunion our class will not be known for how much money we made or how much money we gave back to the school but for how the world was a better place as a result of our leadership words matter and if you listen carefully you might begin to hear a slightly different slightly more purpose oriented dialect gary hamel whom i mentioned above says the goals of management are usually described in words like ôefficiency ôadvantage ôvalue ôsuperiority ôfocus and ôdifferentiation important as these objectives are they lack the power to rouse human hearts business leaders he says must find ways to infuse mundane business activities with deeper soul stirring ideals such as honor truth love justice and beauty humanize what people say and you may well humanize what they do that s the thinking behind the simple and effective way robert b reich former u s labor secretary gauges the health of an organization he calls it the pronoun test when he visits a workplace he ll ask the people employed there some questions about the company he listens to the substance of their response of course but most of all he listens for the pronouns they use do the workers refer to the company as they or do they describe it in terms of we they companies and we companies he says are very different places and in motivation 3 0 we wins policies between the words businesses use and the goals they seek sit the policies they implement to turn the former into the latter here too one can detect the early tremors of a different approach for example many companies in the last decade spent considerable time and effort crafting corporate ethics guidelines yet instances of unethical behavior don t seem to have declined valuable though those guidelines can be as a policy they can unintentionally move purposeful behavior out of the type i schema and into type x as harvard business school professor max bazerman has explained say you take people who are motivated to behave nicely then give them a fairly weak set of ethical standards to meet now instead of asking them to do it because it s the right thing to do you ve essentially given them an alternate set of standards do this so you can check off all these boxes the value of a life can be measured by one s ability to affect the destiny of one less advantaged since death is an absolute certainty for everyone the important variable is the quality of life one leads between the times of birth and death bill stricklandfounder of the manchestercraftsmen s guild and macarthurgenius award winner imagine an organization for example that believes in affirmative action one that wants to make the world a better place by creating a more diverse workforce by reducing ethics to a checklist suddenly affirmative action is just a bunch of requirements that the organization must meet to show that it isn t discriminating now the organization isn t focused on affirmatively pursuing diversity but rather on making sure that all the boxes are checked off to show that what it did is ok and so it won t get sued before its workers had an intrinsic motivation to do the right thing but now they have an extrinsic motivation to make sure that the company doesn t get sued or fined in other words people might meet the minimal ethical standards to avoid punishment but the guidelines have done nothing to inject purpose into the corporate bloodstream the better approach could be to enlist the power of autonomy in the service of purpose maximization two intriguing examples demonstrate what i mean first many psychologists and economists have found that the correlation between money and happiness is weak that past a certain and quite modest level a larger pile of cash doesn t bring people a higher level of satisfaction but a few social scientists have begun adding a bit more nuance to this observation according to lara aknin and elizabeth dunn sociologists at the university of british columbia and michael norton a psychologist at the harvard business school how people spend their money may be at least as important as how much money they earn in particular spending money on other people buying flowers for your spouse rather than an mp3 player for yourself or on a cause donating to a religious institution rather than going for an expensive haircut can actually increase our subjective well being in fact dunn and norton propose turning their findings on what they call pro social spending into corporate policy according to the boston globe they believe that companies can improve their employees emotional well being by shifting some of their budget for charitable giving so that individual employees are given sums to donate leaving them happier even as the charities of their choice benefit in other words handing individual employees control over how the organization gives back to the community might do more to improve their overall satisfaction than one more if then financial incentive another study offers a second possible purpose centered policy prescription physicians in high profile settings like the mayo clinic face pressures and demands that can often lead to burnout but field research at the prestigious medical facility found that letting doctors spend one day a week on the aspect of their job that was most meaningful to them whether patient care research or community service could reduce the physical and emotional exhaustion that accompanies their work doctors who participated in this trial policy had half the burnout rate of those who did not think of it as 20 percent time with a purpose the good life each year about thirteen hundred seniors graduate from the university of rochester and begin their journey into what many of their parents and professors like to call the real world edward deci richard ryan and their colleague christopher niemiec decided to ask a sample of these soon to be graduates about their life goals and then to follow up with them early in their careers to see how they were doing while much social science research is done with student volunteers scientists rarely track students after they ve packed up their diplomas and exited the campus gates and these researchers wanted to study the post college time frame because it represents a critical development period that marks people s transitions to their adult identities and lives some of the u of r students had what deci ryan and niemiec label extrinsic aspirations for instance to become wealthy or to achieve fame what we might call profit goals others had intrinsic aspirations to help others improve their lives to learn and to grow or what we might think of as purpose goals after these students had been out in the real word for between one and two years the researchers tracked them down to see how they were faring the people who d had purpose goals and felt they were attaining them reported higher levels of satisfaction and subjective well being than when they were in college and quite low levels of anxiety and depression that s probably no surprise they d set a personally meaningful goal and felt they were reaching it in that situation most of us would likely feel pretty good too but the results for people with profit goals were more complicated those who said they were attaining their goals accumulating wealth winning acclaim reported levels of satisfaction self esteem and positive affect no higher than when they were students in other words they d reached their goals but it didn t make them any happier what s more graduates with profit goals showed increases in anxiety depression and other negative indicators again even though they were attaining their goals one cannot lead a life that is truly excellent without feeling that one belongs to something greater and more permanent than oneself mihaly csikszentmihalyi these findings are rather striking the researchers write as they suggest that attainment of a particular set of goals in this case profit goals has no impact on well being and actually contributes to i ll being when i discussed these results with deci and ryan they were especially emphatic about their significance because the findings suggest that even when we do get what we want it s not always what we need people who are very high in extrinsic goals for wealth are more likely to attain that wealth but they re still unhappy ryan told me or as deci put it the typical notion is this you value something you attain it then you re better off as a function of it but what we find is that there are certain things that if you value and if you attain them you re worse off as a result of it not better off failing to understand this conundrum that satisfaction depends not merely on having goals but on having the right goals can lead sensible people down self destructive paths if people chase profit goals reach those goals and still don t feel any better about their lives one response is to increase the size and scope of the goals to seek more money or greater outside validation and that can drive them down a road of further unhappiness thinking it s the road to happiness ryan said one of the reasons for anxiety and depression in the high attainers is that they re not having good relationships they re busy making money and attending to themselves and that means that there s less room in their lives for love and attention and caring and empathy and the things that truly count ryan added and if the broad contours of these findings are true for individuals why shouldn t they also be true for organizations which of course are collections of individuals i don t mean to say that profit doesn t matter it does the profit motive has been an important fuel for achievement but it s not the only motive and it s not the most important one indeed if we were to look at history s greatest achievements from the printing press to constitutional democracy to cures for deadly diseases the spark that kept the creators working deep into the night was purpose at least as much as profit a healthy society and healthy business organizations begins with purpose and considers profit a way to move toward that end or a happy by product of its attainment and here the boomers maybe just maybe can take the lead on the subjects of autonomy and mastery adults should look to the eloquent example of children but perhaps purpose is another matter being able to contemplate the big picture to ponder one s own mortality to understand the paradox that attaining certain goals isn t the answer seem to require having spent a few years on the planet and since the planet very soon will contain more people over age sixty five than under age five for the first time in its existence the timing couldn t be better it s in our nature to seek purpose but that nature is now being revealed and expressed on a scale that is demographically unprecedented and until recently scarcely imaginable the consequences could rejuvenate our businesses and remake our world a central idea of this book has been the mismatch between what science knows and what business does the gap is wide its existence is alarming and though closing it seems daunting we have reasons to be optimistic the scientists who study human motivation several of whom we ve encountered in this book offer us a sharper and more accurate account of both human performance and the human condition the truths they ve revealed are simple yet powerful the science shows that those typical twentieth century carrot and stick motivators things we consider somehow a natural part of human enterprise can sometimes work but they re effective in only a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances the science shows that if then rewards the mainstays of the motivation 2 0 operating system not only are ineffective in many situations but also can crush the high level creative conceptual abilities that are central to current and future economic and social progress the science shows that the secret to high performance isn t our biological drive or our reward and punishment drive but our third drive our deep seated desire to direct our own lives to extend and expand our abilities and to live a life of purpose bringing our businesses in sync with these truths won t be easy unlearning old ideas is difficult undoing old habits even harder and i d be less sanguine about the prospects of closing the motivation gap anytime soon if it weren t for this the science confirms what we already know in our hearts we know that human beings are not merely smaller slower better smelling horses galloping after that day s carrot we know if we ve spent time with young children or remember ourselves at our best that we re not destined to be passive and compliant we re designed to be active and engaged and we know that the richest experiences in our lives aren t when we re clamoring for validation from others but when we re listening to our own voice doing something that matters doing it well and doing it in the service of a cause larger than ourselves so in the end repairing the mismatch and bringing our understanding of motivation into the twenty first century is more than an essential move for business it s an affirmation of our humanity drive part three

mastery and purpose into our work and life here are nine exercises to get you on the right track give yourself a flow test m ihaly csikszentmihalyi did more than discover the concept of flow he also introduced an ingenious new technique to measure it csikszentmihalyi and his university of chicago team equipped participants in their research studies with electronic pagers then they paged people at random intervals approximately eight times a day for a week asking them to describe their mental state at that moment compared with previous methods these real time reports proved far more honest and revealing you can use csikszentmihalyi s methodological innovation in your own quest for mastery by giving yourself a flow test set a reminder on your computer or mobile phone to go off at forty random times in a week each time your device beeps write down what you re doing how you re feeling and whether you re in flow record your observations look at the patterns and consider the following questions which moments produced feelings of flow where were you what were you working on who were you with are certain times of day more flow friendly than others how could you restructure your day based on your findings how might you increase the number of optimal experiences and reduce the moments when you felt disengaged or distracted if you re having doubts about your job or career what does this exercise tell you about your true source of intrinsic motivation first ask a big question i n 1962 clare boothe luce one of the first women to serve in the u s congress offered some advice to president john f kennedy a great man she told him is one sentence abraham lincoln s sentence was he preserved the union and freed the slaves franklin roosevelt s was he lifted us out of a great depression and helped us win a world war luce feared that kennedy s attention was so splintered among different priorities that his sentence risked becoming a muddled paragraph you don t have to be a president of the united states or of your local gardening club to learn from this tale one way to orient your life toward greater purpose is to think about your sentence maybe it s he raised four kids who became happy and healthy adults or she invented a device that made people s lives easier or he cared for every person who walked into his office regardless of whether that person could pay or she taught two generations of children how to read as you contemplate your purpose begin with the big question what s your sentence then keep asking a small question t he big question is necessary but not sufficient that s where the small question comes in real achievement doesn t happen overnight as anyone who s trained for a marathon learned a new language or run a successful division can attest you spend a lot more time grinding through tough tasks than you do basking in applause here s something you can do to keep yourself motivated at the end of each day ask yourself whether you were better today than you were yesterday did you do more did you do it well or to get specific did you learn your ten vocabulary words make your eight sales calls eat your five servings of fruits and vegetables write your four pages you don t have to be flawless each day instead look for small measures of improvement such as how long you practiced your saxophone or whether you held off on checking e mail until you finished that report you needed to write reminding yourself that you don t need to be a master by day 3 is the best way of ensuring you will be one by day 3 000 so before you go to sleep each night ask yourself the small question was i better today than yesterday take a sagmeister t he designer stefan sagmeister has found a brilliant way to ensure he s living a type i life think about the standard pattern in developed countries he says people usually spend the first twenty five or so years of their lives learning the next forty or so years working and the final twenty five in retirement that boilerplate timeline got sagmeister wondering why not snip five years from retirement and sprinkle them into your working years so every seven years sagmeister closes his graphic design shop tells his clients he won t be back for a year and goes off on a 365 day sabbatical he uses the time to travel to live places he s never been and to experiment with new projects it sounds risky i know but he says the ideas he generates during the year off often provide his income for the next seven years taking a sagmeister as i now call it requires a fair bit of planning and saving of course but doesn t forgoing that big screen tv seem a small price to pay for an unforgettable and un get backable year of personal exploration the truth is this idea is more realistic than many of us realize which is why i hope to take a sagmeister in a couple of years and why you should consider it too give yourself a performance review p erformance reviews those annual or biannual rituals of organizational life are about as enjoyable as a toothache and as productive as a train wreck nobody likes them not the giver not the receiver they don t really help us achieve mastery since the feedback often comes six months after the work is complete imagine serena williams or twyla tharp seeing their results or reading reviews only twice a year and yet managers keep on hauling employees into their offices for those awkward painful encounters maybe there s a better way maybe as douglas mcgregor and others have suggested we should give ourselves our own performance reviews here s how figure out your goals mostly learning goals but also a few performance goals and then every month call yourself to your office and give yourself an appraisal how are you faring where are you falling short what tools information or support might you need to do better some other hints set both smaller and larger goals so that when it comes time to evaluate yourself you ve already accomplished some whole tasks make sure you understand how every aspect of your work relates to your larger purpose be brutally honest this exercise is aimed at helping you improve performance and achieve mastery so if you rationalize failures or gloss over your mistakes instead of learning from them you re wasting your time and if doing this solo isn t your thing gather a small group of colleagues for regular peer based do it yourself performance reviews if your comrades really care they ll tell you the truth and hold you accountable one last question for bosses why in god s name are you not encouraging all your employees to do this get unstuck by going oblique e ven the most intrinsically motivated person sometimes gets stuck so here s a simple easy and fun way to power out of your mental morass in 1975 producer brian eno and artist peter schmidt published a set of one hundred cards containing strategies that helped them overcome the pressure packed moments that always accompany a deadline each card contains a single often inscrutable question or statement to push you out of a mental rut some examples what would your closest friend do your mistake was a hidden intention what is the simplest solution repetition is a form of change don t avoid what is easy if you re working on a project and find yourself stymied pull an oblique card from the deck these brain bombs are a great way to keep your mind open despite constraints you can t control you can buy the deck at or follow one of the twitter accounts inspired by the strategies such as move five steps closer to mastery o ne key to mastery is what florida state university psychology professor anders ericsson calls deliberate practice a lifelong period of effort to improve performance in a specific domain deliberate practice isn t running a few miles each day or banging on the piano for twenty minutes each morning it s much more purposeful focused and yes painful follow these steps over and over again for a decade and you just might become a master remember that deliberate practice has one objective to improve performance people who play tennis once a week for years don t get any better if they do the same thing each time ericsson has said deliberate practice is about changing your performance setting new goals and straining yourself to reach a bit higher each time repeat repeat repeat repetition matters basketball greats don t shoot ten free throws at the end of team practice they shoot five hundred seek constant critical feedback if you don t know how you re doing you won t know what to improve focus ruthlessly on where you need help while many of us work on what we re already good at says ericsson those who get better work on their weaknesses prepare for the process to be mentally and physically exhausting that s why so few people commit to it but that s why it works take a page from webber and a card from your pocket i n his insightful book rules of thumb fast company magazine cofounder alan webber offers a smart and simple exercise for assessing whether you re on the path to autonomy mastery and purpose get a few blank three by five inch cards on one of the cards write your answer to this question what gets you up in the morning now on the other side of the card write your answer to another question what keeps you up at night pare each response to a single sentence and if you don t like an answer toss the card and try again until you ve crafted something you can live with then read what you ve produced if both answers give you a sense of meaning and direction congratulations says webber use them as your compass checking from time to time to see if they re still true if you don t like one or both of your answers it opens up a new question what are you going to do about it create your own motivational poster office posters that try to motivate us have a grim reputation as one wag put it for the last two decades motivational posters have inflicted unimaginable suffering on the workplaces of the world but who knows perhaps the first one was a thing of beauty maybe those cave drawings in lascaux france were some paleolithic motivational speaker s

20 percent time where organizations encourage employees to spend one fifth of their hours working on any project they want and if you ve ever used gmail or read google news you ve benefited from the results but for all the virtues of this type i innovation putting such a policy in place can seem daunting how much will it cost what if it doesn t work if you re feeling skittish here s an idea go with a more modest version 20 percent time with training wheels start with say 10 percent time that s just one afternoon of a five day workweek who among us hasn t wasted that amount of time at work anyway and instead of committing to it forever try it for six months by creating this island of autonomy you ll help people act on their great ideas and convert their downtime into more productive

using a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 meaning almost none and 10 meaning a huge amount 1 how much autonomy do you have over your tasks at work your main responsibilities and what you do in a given day 2 how much autonomy do you have over your time at work for instance when you arrive when you leave and how you allocate your hours each day 3 how much autonomy do you have over your team at work that is to what extent are you able to choose the people with whom you typically collaborate 4 how much autonomy do you have over your technique at work how you actually perform the main responsibilities of your job make sure all responses are anonymous then tabulate the results what s the employee average the figure will fall somewhere on a 40 point autonomy scale with 0 being a north korean prison and 40 being woodstock compare that number to people s perceptions perhaps the boss thought everyone had plenty of freedom but the audit showed an average autonomy rating of only 15 also calculate separate results for task time team and technique a healthy overall average can sometimes mask a problem in a particular area an overall autonomy rating of say 27 isn t bad however if that average consists of 8 each for task technique and team but only 3 for time you ve identified an autonomy weak spot in the organization it s remarkable sometimes how little the people running organizations know about the experiences of the people working around them but it s equally remarkable how often leaders are willing to do things differently if they see real data that s what an autonomy audit can do and if you include a section in your audit for employees to jot down their own ideas about increasing autonomy you might even find some great solutions take three steps toward giving up control t ype x bosses relish control type i bosses relinquish control extending people the freedom they need to do great work is usually wise but it s not always easy so if you re feeling the urge to control here are three ways to begin letting go for your own benefit and your team s 1 involve people in goal setting would you rather set your own goals or have them foisted upon you thought so why should those working with you be any different a considerable body of research shows that individuals are far more engaged when they re pursuing goals they had a hand in creating so bring employees into the process they could surprise you people often have higher aims than the ones you assign them 2 use noncontrolling language next time you re about to say must or should try saying think about or consider instead a small change in wording can help promote engagement over compliance and might even reduce some people s urge to defy think about it or at least consider it okay 3 hold office hours sometimes you need to summon people into your office but sometimes it s wise to let them come to you take a cue from college professors and set aside one or two hours a week when your schedule is clear and any employee can come in and talk to you about anything that s on her mind your colleagues might benefit and you might learn something play whose purpose is it anyway t his is another exercise designed to close the gap between perception and reality gather your team your department or if you can all the employees in your outfit hand everyone a blank three by five inch card then ask each person to write down his or her one sentence answer to the following question what is our company s or organization s purpose collect the cards and read them aloud what do they tell you are the answers similar everyone aligned along a common purpose or are they all over the place some people believing one thing others something completely different and still others without even a guess for all the talk about culture alignment and mission most organizations do a pretty shabby job of assessing this aspect of their business this simple inquiry can offer a glimpse into the soul of your enterprise if people don t know why they re doing what they re doing how can you expect them to be motivated to do it use reich s pronoun test f ormer u s labor secretary robert b reich has devised a smart simple and free diagnostic tool for measuring the health of an organization when he talks to employees he listens carefully for the pronouns they use do employees refer to their company as they or as we they suggests at least some amount of disengagement and perhaps even alienation we suggests the opposite that employees feel they re part of something significant and meaningful if you re a boss spend a few days listening to the people around you not only in formal settings like meetings but in the hallways and at lunch as well are you a we organization or a they organization the difference matters everybody wants autonomy mastery and purpose the thing is we can get it but they can t design for intrinsic motivation i nternet guru and author clay shirky says that the most successful websites and electronic forums have a certain type i approach in their dna they re designed often explicitly to tap intrinsic motivation you can do the same with your online presence if you listen to shirky and create an environment that makes people feel good about participating give users autonomy keep the system as open as possible and what matters in cyberspace matters equally in physical space ask yourself how does the built environment of your workplace promote or inhibit autonomy mastery and purpose promote goldilocks for groups a lmost everyone has experienced the satisfaction of a goldilocks task the kind that s neither too easy nor too hard that delivers a delicious sense of flow but sometimes it s difficult to replicate that experience when you re working in a team people often end up doing the jobs they always do because they ve proven they can do them well and an unfortunate few get saddled with the flow free tasks nobody else wants here are a few ways to bring a little goldilocks to your group begin with a diverse team as harvard s teresa amabile advises set up work groups so that people will stimulate each other and learn from each other so that they re not homogeneous in terms of their backgrounds and training you want people who can really cross fertilize each other s ideas make your group a no competition zone pitting coworkers against one another in the hope that competition will spark them to perform better rarely works and almost always undermines intrinsic motivation if you re going to use a c word go with collaboration or cooperation try a little task shifting if someone is bored with his current assignment see if he can train someone else in the skills he s already mastered then see if he can take on some aspect of a more experienced team member s work animate with purpose don t motivate with rewards nothing bonds a team like a shared mission the more that people share a common cause whether it s creating something insanely great outperforming an outside competitor or even changing the world the more your group will do deeply satisfying and outstanding work turn your next off site into a fedex day b ehold the company off site a few spirit sapping days of forced fun and manufactured morale featuring awkward pep talks wretched dancing and a few trust falls to be fair some off sites reengage employees recharge people s batteries and restart conversations on big issues but if your organization s off sites are falling short why not try replacing the next one with a fedex day set aside an entire day where employees can work on anything they choose however they want with whomever they d like make sure they have the tools and resources they need and impose just one rule people must deliver something a new idea a prototype of a product a better internal process the following day type i organizations know what their type x counterparts rarely comprehend real challenges are far more invigorating than controlled leisure the zen of compensation paying people the type i way everybody wants to be paid well i sure do i bet you re the same the type i approach to motivation doesn t require bargain basement wages or an all volunteer workforce but it does demand a new approach to pay think of this new approach as the zen of compensation in motivation 3 0 the best use of money is to take the issue of money off the table the more prominent salary perks and benefits are in someone s work life the more they can inhibit creativity and unravel performance as edward deci explained in chapter 3 when organizations use rewards like money to motivate staff that s when they re most demotivating the better strategy is to get compensation right and then get it out of sight effective organizations compensate people in amounts and in ways that allow individuals to mostly forget about compensation and instead focus on the work itself here are three key techniques 1 ensure internal and external fairness t he most important aspect of any compensation package is fairness and here fairness comes in two varieties internal and external internal fairness means paying people commensurate with their colleagues external fairness means paying people in line with others doing similar work in similar organizations let s look at each type of fairness suppose you and fred have adjoining cubicles and suppose you ve got pretty much equivalent responsibility and experience if fred makes scads more money than you you ll be miffed because of this violation of internal fairness your motivation will plummet now suppose instead that you and fred are both auditors with ten years experience working in a fortune 200 company if you discover that similarly experienced auditors at other fortune 200 firms are making double your salaries both you and fred will experience a largely irreversible motivation dip the company has violated the ethic of external fairness one important addendum paying people the type i way doesn t mean paying everyone the same amount if fred has a harder job or contributes more to the organization than you he deserves a richer deal and as it turns out several studies have shown that most people don t have a beef with that why it s fair getting the internal and external equity right isn t itself a motivator but it is a way to avoid putting the issue of money back on the table and making it a de motivator 2 pay more than average i f you have provided adequate baseline rewards and established internal and external fairness consider borrowing a strategy first surfaced by a nobel laureate in the mid 1980s george akerlof who later won the nobel prize in economics and his wife janet yellen who s also an economist discovered that some companies seemed to be overpaying their workers instead of paying employees the wages that supply and demand would have predicted they gave their workers a little more it wasn t because the companies were selfless and it wasn t because they were stupid it was because they were savvy paying great people a little more than the market demands akerlof and yellen found could attract better talent reduce turnover and boost productivity and morale higher wages could actually reduce a company s costs the pay more than average approach can offer an elegant way to bypass if then rewards eliminate concerns about unfairness and help take the issue of money off the table it s another way to allow people to focus on the work itself indeed other economists have shown that providing an employee a high level of base pay does more to boost performance and organizational commitment than an attractive bonus structure of course by the very nature of the exercise paying above the average will work for only about half of you so get going before your competitors do 3 if you use performance metrics make them wide ranging relevant and hard to game i magine you re a product manager and your pay depends largely on reaching a particular sales goal for the next quarter if you re smart or if you ve got a family to feed you re going to try mightily to hit that number you probably won t concern yourself much with the quarter after that or the health of the company or whether the firm is investing enough in research and development and if you re nervous you might cut corners to reach your quarterly goal now imagine you re a product manager and your pay is determined by these factors your sales for the next quarter your sales in the current year the company s revenue and profit in the next two years levels of satisfaction among your customers ideas for new products and evaluations of your coworkers if you re smart you ll probably try to sell your product serve your customers help your teammates and well do good work when metrics are varied they re harder to finagle in addition the gain for reaching the metrics shouldn t be too large when the payoff for reaching targets is modest rather than massive it s less likely to narrow people s focus or encourage them to take the low road to be sure finding the right mix of metrics is difficult and will vary considerably across organizations and some people will inevitably find a way to game even the most carefully calibrated system but using a variety of measures that reflect the totality of great work can transform often counterproductive if then rewards into less combustible now that rewards type i for parents and educators nine ideas for helping our kids all kids start out as curious self directed type i s but many of them end up as disengaged compliant type x s what s going on maybe the problem is us the adults who are running schools and heading families if we want to equip young people for the new world of work and more important if we want them to lead satisfying lives we need to break motivation 2 0 s grip on education and parenting unfortunately as with business there s a mismatch between what science knows and what schools do science knows and you do too if you read chapter 2 that if you promise a preschooler a fancy certificate for drawing a picture that child will likely draw a picture for you and then lose further interest in drawing yet in the face of this evidence and as the world economy demands more nonroutine creative conceptual abilities too many schools are moving in the wrong direction they re redoubling their emphasis on routines right answers and standardization and they re hauling out a wagon full of if then rewards pizza for reading books ipods for showing up to class cash for good test scores we re bribing students into compliance instead of challenging them into engagement we can do better and we should if we want to raise type i kids at school and at home we need to help them move toward autonomy mastery and purpose here are nine ways to start the journey apply the three part type i test for homework d oes the homework bulging from kids backpacks truly help them learn or does it simply steal their free time in the service of a false sense of rigor teachers before you dole out yet another time consuming assignment run it through this type i homework test by asking yourself three questions am i offering students any autonomy over how and when to do this work does this assignment promote mastery by offering a novel engaging task as opposed to rote reformulation of something already covered in class do my students understand the purpose of this assignment that is can they see how doing this additional activity at home contributes to the larger enterprise in which the class is engaged if the answer to any of these questions is no can you refashion the assignment and parents are you looking at homework assignments every so often to see whether they promote compliance or engagement let s not waste our kids time on meaningless exercises with a little thought and effort we can then home work into home learning have a fedex day i n chapter 4 we learned how the software company atlassian injects a burst of autonomy into its workplace by setting aside a day each quarter when employees can work on any project they choose however they want with whomever they d like why not try this with your students or even your own sons and daughters set aside an entire school day or a family vacation day and ask kids to come up with a problem to solve or a project to tackle in advance help them collect the tools information and supplies they might need then let them have at it the next morning ask them to deliver by reporting back to the class or the family on their discoveries and experiences it s like project runway only the kids come up with the project themselves and the reward at the end of the day is the chance to share what they ve created and all they ve learned along the way try diy report cards t oo many students walk through the schoolhouse door with one aim in mind to get good grades and all too often the best way to reach this goal is to get with the program avoid risks and serve up the answers the teacher wants the way the teacher wants them good grades become a reward for compliance but don t have much to do with learning meanwhile students whose grades don t measure up often see themselves as failures and give up trying to learn the type i approach is different report cards are not a potential prize but a way to offer students useful feedback on their progress and type i students understand that a great way to get feedback is to evaluate their own progress so try experimenting with the diy do it yourself report card at the beginning of a semester ask students to list their top learning goals then at the end of the semester ask them to create their own report card along with a one or two paragraph review of their progress where did they succeed where did they fall short what more do they need to learn once students have completed their diy report cards show them the teacher s report card and let the comparison of the two be the start of a conversation on how they are doing on their path toward mastery maybe even include students in any parent teacher conferences parents if your child s teacher won t go for these diy report cards try it yourself at home it s another way to prevent school from changing your child s default setting and turning him from type i to type x give your kids an allowance and some chores but don t combine them h ere s why an allowance is good for kids having a little of their own money and deciding how to save or spend it offers a measure of autonomy and teaches them to be responsible with cash here s why household chores are good for kids chores show kids that families are built on mutual obligations and that family members need to help each other here s why combining allowances with chores is not good for kids by linking money to the completion of chores parents turn an allowance into an if then reward this sends kids a clear and clearly wrongheaded message in the absence of a payment no self respecting child would willingly set the table empty the garbage or make her own bed it converts a moral and familial obligation into just another commercial transaction and teaches that the only reason to do a less than desirable task for your family is in exchange for payment this is a case where combining two good things give you less not more so keep allowance and chores separate and you just might get that trash can emptied even better your kids will begin to learn the difference between principles and payoffs offer praise the right way d one right praise is an important way to give kids feedback and encouragement but done wrong praise can become yet another if then reward that can squash creativity and stifle intrinsic motivation the powerful work of psychologist carol dweck as well as others in the field offers a how to list for offering praise in a way that promotes type i behavior praise effort and strategy not intelligence as dweck s research has shown children who are praised for being smart often believe that every encounter is a test of whether they really are so to avoid looking dumb they resist new challenges and choose the easiest path by contrast kids who understand that effort and hard work lead to mastery and growth are more willing to take on new difficult tasks make praise specific parents and teachers should give kids useful information about their performance instead of bathing them in generalities tell them specifically what they ve done that s noteworthy praise in private praise is feedback not an award ceremony that s why it s often best to offer it one on one in private offer praise only when there s a good reason for it don t kid a kid he can see through fake praise in a nanosecond be sincere or keep quiet if you overpraise kids regard it as dishonest and unearned plus overpraising becomes another if then reward that makes earning praise rather than moving toward mastery the objective help kids see the big picture i n education systems tilted toward standardized tests grades and if then rewards students often have no idea why they re doing what they re doing turn that around by helping them glimpse the big picture whatever they re studying be sure they can answer these questions why am i learning this how is it relevant to the world i live in now then get out of the classroom and apply what they re studying if they re learning spanish take them to an office a store or a community center where they can actually speak the language if they re studying geometry have them draw up architectural plans for an addition to your school or home if they re taking history ask them to apply what they ve learned to an event in the news think of it as the fourth r reading writing arithmetic and relevance check out these five type i schools a lthough most schools around the world are still built atop the motivation 2 0 operating system a number of forward thinking educators have long understood that young people are brimming with the third drive here are five type i schools in the united states with practices to emulate and stories to inspire big picture learning since 1996 with the opening of its flagship public high school the met in providence rhode island big picture learning has been creating places that cultivate engagement rather than demand compliance founded by two veteran education innovators dennis littky and elliot washor big picture is a nonprofit that now has sixty plus schools around the united states that put students in charge of their own education big picture kids get the basics but they also use those basics and acquire other skills by doing real work in the community all under the guidance of an experienced adult tutor and instead of easily gamed motivation 2 0 measurements big picture kids are assessed the way adults are on work performance individual presentations effort attitude and behavior on the job most of the students at the met and other big picture schools are at risk low income and minority kids who ve been poorly served by conventional schools yet thanks to this innovative type i approach more than 95 percent graduate and go on to college for more information go to full disclosure i have served unpaid on the board of directors of big picture since 2007 sudbury valley school take a look at this independent school in framingham massachusetts to see what happens when young kids have genuine autonomy working from the assumption that all human beings are naturally curious and that the best kind of learning happens when it s initiated and pursued by the one doing the learning sudbury valley school gives its students total control over the task time and technique of their learning teachers and staff are there to help them make things happen this is a school where engagement is the rule and compliance isn t an option for more information go to the tinkering school more of a lab than a school this summer program created by computer scientist gever tulley lets children from seven to seventeen play around with interesting stuff and build cool things at the headquarters in montara california tulley s tinkerers have built working zip lines motorcycles toothbrush robots roller coasters and plastic bag bridges strong enough to hold people most of us aren t able to ship our kids out to california for a week of tinkering but we can all learn the five dangerous things you should let your children do so take nine minutes to listen to tulley s 2007 online ted talk of that title then hand your kids a pocket knife some power tools and a book of matches and get out of the way for more information go to includes a link to tulley s talk puget sound community school like sudbury and big picture this tiny independent school in seattle washington gives its students a radical dose of autonomy turning the one size fits all approach of conventional schools on its head each student has an adviser who acts as her personal coach helping her come up with her own learning goals school consists of a mixture of class time and self created independent study projects along with community service devised by the students since youngsters are often away from campus they gain a clear sense that their learning has a real world purpose and rather than chase after grades they receive frequent informal feedback from advisers teachers and peers for more information go to montessori schools dr maria montessori developed the montessori method of teaching in the early 1900s after observing children s natural curiosity and innate desire to learn her early understanding of the third drive spawned a worldwide network of schools mostly for preschool and primary aged children many of the key tenets of a montessori education resonate with the principles of motivation 3 0 that children naturally engage in self directed learning and independent study that teachers should act as observers and facilitators of that learning and not as lecturers or commanders and that children are naturally inclined to experience periods of intense focus concentration and flow that adults should do their best not to interrupt although montessori schools are rare at the junior high and high school levels every school educator and parent can learn from its enduring and successful approach meantime while you re investigating montessori check out two other approaches to learning that also promote type i behavior the reggio emilia philosophy for the education of young children and the waldorf schools for more information visit these websites and take a class from the unschoolers i n the united states the homeschooling movement has been growing at a remarkable pace over the past twenty years and the fastest growing segment of that movement is the unschoolers families that don t use a formal curriculum and instead allow their children to explore and learn what interests them unschoolers have been among the first to adopt a type i approach to education they promote autonomy by allowing youngsters to decide what they learn and how they learn it they encourage mastery by allowing children to spend as long as they d like and to go as deep as they desire on the topics that interest them even if unschooling is not for you or your kids you can learn a thing or two from these educational innovators start by reading john taylor gatto s extraordinary book dumbing us down take a look at home education magazine and its website then check out some of the many other unschooling sites on the web for more information go to and turn students into teachers o ne of the best ways to know whether you ve mastered something is to try to teach it give students that opportunity assign each pupil in a class a different aspect of the broader topic you re studying and then have them take turns teaching what they ve learned to their classmates and once they ve got it down give them a wider audience by inviting other classes teachers parents or school administrators to learn what they have to teach also at the start of a school term ask students about their individual passions and areas of expertise keep a list of your experts and then call upon them as needed throughout the term a classroom of teachers is a classroom of learners the type i reading list fifteen essential books autonomy mastery and purpose are integral to the human condition so it s no surprise that a number of writers from psychologists to journalists to novelists have explored these three elements and probed what they mean for our lives this list of books arranged alphabetically by author isn t exhaustive but it s a good starting point for anyone interested in cultivating a type i life finite and infinite games a vision of life as play and possibility by james p carse in his elegant little book religious scholar carse describes two types of games a finite game has a winner and an end the goal is to triumph an infinite game has no winner and no end the goal is to keep playing nonwinnable games carse explains are much more rewarding than the win lose ones we re accustomed to playing at our work and in our relationships type i insight finite players play within boundaries infinite players play with boundaries talent is overrated what really separates world class performers from everybody else by geoff colvin what s the difference between those who are pretty good at what they do and those who are masters fortune magazine s colvin scours the evidence and shows that the answer is threefold

csikszentmihalyi it s tough to find a better argument for working hard at something you love than csikszentmihalyi s landmark book on optimal experiences flow describes those exhilarating moments when we feel in control full of purpose and in the zone and it reveals how people have turned even the most unpleasant tasks into enjoyable rewarding challenges type i insight contrary to what we usually believe the best moments in our lives are not the passive receptive relaxing times although such experiences can also be enjoyable if we have worked hard to attain them the best moments usually occur when a person s body or mind is stretched to the limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile for more of csikszentmihalyi s ideas check out three of his other books

readable prose he discusses the limitations of a society based on control explains the origins of his landmark experiments and shows how to promote autonomy in the many realms of our lives type i insight the questions so many people ask namely ôhow do i motivate people to learn to work to do their chores or to take their medicine are the wrong questions they are wrong because they imply that motivation is something that gets done to people rather than something that people do mindset the new psychology of success by carol dweck stanford s dweck distills her decades of research to a simple pair of ideas people can have two different mindsets she says those with a fixed mindset believe that their talents and abilities are carved in stone those with a growth mindset believe that their talents and abilities can be developed fixed mindsets see every encounter as a test of their worthiness growth mindsets see the same encounters as opportunities to improve dweck s message go with growth type i insight in the book and likewise on her website dweck offers concrete steps for moving from a fixed to a growth mindset learn to listen for a fixed mindset voice that might be hurting your resiliency interpret challenges not as roadblocks but as opportunities to stretch yourself use the language of growth for example i m not sure i can do it now but i think i can learn with time and effort then we came to the end by joshua ferris this darkly hilarious debut novel is a cautionary tale for the demoralizing effects of the type x workplace at an unnamed ad agency in chicago people spend more time scarfing free doughnuts and scamming office chairs than doing actual work all while fretting about walking spanish down the hall office lingo for being fired type i insight they had taken away our flowers our summer days and our bonuses we were on a wage freeze and a hiring freeze and people were flying out the door like so many dismantled dummies we had one thing still going for us the prospect of a promotion a new title true it came with no money the power was almost always illusory the bestowal a cheap shrewd device concocted by management to keep us from mutiny but when word circulated that one of us had jumped up an acronym that person was just a little quieter that day took a longer lunch than usual came back with shopping bags spent the afternoon speaking softly into the telephone and left whenever they wanted that night while the rest of us sent emails flying back and forth on the lofty topics of injustice and uncertainty good work when excellence and ethics meet by howard gardner mihaly csikszentmihalyi and william damon how can you do good work in an age of relentless market forces and lightning fast technology by considering three basic issues your profession s mission its standards or best practices and your own identity although this book focuses mainly on examples from the fields of genetics and journalism its insights can be applied to

the idea of the self made man success is more complicated he says high achievers from young canadian hockey players to bill gates to the beatles are often the products of hidden advantages of culture timing demographics and luck that helped them become masters in their fields reading this book will lead you to reevaluate your own path more important it will make you wonder how much human potential we re losing when so many people are denied these advantages type i insight it is not how much money we make that ultimately makes us happy between nine to five it s whether our work fulfills us if i offered you a choice between being an architect for 75 000 a year and working in a tollbooth every day for the rest of your life for 100 000 a year which would you take i m guessing the former because there is complexity autonomy and a relationship between effort and reward in doing creative work and that s worth more to most of us than money team of rivals the political genius of abraham lincoln by doris kearns goodwin in her entertaining popular history goodwin shows abraham lincoln as an exemplar of type i behavior he worked mightily to achieve mastery in law and politics he gave his staunchest rivals power and autonomy and he developed a leadership style rooted in a higher purpose ending slavery and keeping the union intact type i insight goodwin sheds light on lincoln s type i leadership skills among them he was self confident enough to surround himself with rivals who excelled in areas where he was weak he genuinely listened to other people s points of view which helped him form more complex opinions of his own he gave credit where it was due and wasn t afraid to take the blame the amateurs the story of four young men and their quest for an olympic gold medal by

obstacles that stand in the way of creative freedom and a spirited battle plan for overcoming the resistance that arises when we set out to do something great if you re looking for a quick jolt on your journey toward mastery this is it type i insight it may be that the human race is not ready for freedom the air of liberty may be too rarified for us to breathe certainly i wouldn t be writing this book on this subject if living with freedom were easy the paradox seems to be as socrates demonstrated long ago that the truly free individual is free only to the extent of his own self mastery

business thinkers offer some wise guidance for designing organizations that promote autonomy mastery and purpose douglas mcgregor who a social psychologist and one of the first professors at mit s sloan school of management his landmark 1960 book the human side of enterprise gave the practice of management a badly needed shot of humanism big idea theory x vs theory y mcgregor described two very different approaches to management each based on a different assumption about human behavior the first approach which he called theory x assumed that people avoid effort work only for money and security and therefore need to be controlled the second which he called theory y assumed that work is as natural for human beings as play or rest that initiative and creativity are widespread and that if people are committed to a goal they will actually seek responsibility theory y he argued was the more accurate and ultimately more effective approach type i insight managers frequently complain to me about the fact that subordinates ônowadays won t take responsibility i have been interested to note how often these same managers keep a constant surveillance over the day to day performance of subordinates sometimes two or three levels below themselves more info as i explained in chapter 3 the human side of enterprise is a key ancestor of motivation 3 0 although mcgregor wrote the book a full fifty years ago his observations about the limits of control remain smart fresh and relevant peter f drucker who the most influential management thinker of the twentieth century he wrote an astonishing forty one books influenced the thinking of two generations of ceos received a u s presidential medal of freedom and taught for three decades at the claremont graduate university business school that now bears his name big idea self management drucker s primary contribution is not a single idea jim collins once wrote but rather an entire body of work that has one gigantic advantage nearly all of it is essentially right drucker coined the term knowledge worker foresaw the rise of the nonprofit sector and was among the first to stress the primacy of the customer in business strategy but although he s best known for his thoughts on managing businesses toward the end of his career drucker signaled the next frontier self management with the rise of individual longevity and the decline of job security he argued individuals have to think hard about where their strengths lie what they can contribute and how they can improve their own performance the need to manage oneself he wrote shortly before he died in 2005 is creating a revolution in human affairs type i insight demanding of knowledge workers that they define their own task and its results is necessary because knowledge workers must be autonomous workers should be asked to think through their own work plans and then to submit them what am i going to focus on what results can be expected for which i should be held accountable by what deadline more info drucker wrote many books and many have been written about him but a great starting place is the daily drucker a small gem that provides 366 insights and

motivate people is largely a waste of time collins wrote in good to great if you have the right people on the bus they will be self motivated the real question then becomes how do you manage in such a way as not to de motivate people type i insight collins suggests four basic practices for creating a culture where self motivation can flourish 1 lead with questions not answers 2 engage in dialogue

staying healthy and vital to help you bring the spirit of intrinsic motivation out of the office and classroom and into another realm of your life here are four tips for staying fit the type i way set your own goals don t accept some standardized cookie cutter exercise plan create one that s tailored to your needs and fitness level you can work with a professional on this but you make the final calls equally important set the right kinds of goals ample research in behavioral science shows that people who seek to lose weight for extrinsic reasons to slim down for a wedding or to look better at a class reunion often reach their goals and then they gain the weight back as soon as the target event ends meanwhile people who pursue more intrinsic goals to get fit in order to feel good or to stay healthy for their family make slower progress at first but achieve significantly better results in the long term ditch the treadmill unless you really like treadmills that is if trudging to the gym feels like a dreary obligation find a form of fitness you enjoy that produces those intoxicating moments of flow gather some friends for an informal game of tennis or basketball join an amateur league go for walks at a local park dance for a half hour or play with your kids use the sawyer effect to your advantage and turn your work out into play keep mastery in mind getting better at something provides a great source of renewable energy so pick an activity in which you can improve over time by continually increasing the difficulty of what you take on think goldilocks and setting more audacious challenges for yourself as time passes you can renew that energy and stay motivated reward yourself the right way if you re really struggling consider a quick experiment with stickk a website in which you publicly commit to a goal and must hand over money to a friend a charity or an anti charity if you fail to reach it but in general don t bribe yourself with if then rewards like if i exercise four times this week then i ll buy myself a new shirt they can backfire but the occasional now that reward not a problem so if you ve swum the distance you hoped to this week there s no harm in treating yourself to a massage afterward it won t hurt and it might feel good drive the recap this book has covered a lot of ground and you might not be able to instantly recall everything in it so here you ll find three different summaries of drive think of it as your talking points refresher course or memory jogger twitter summary carrots sticks are so last century drive says for 21st century work we need to upgrade to autonomy mastery purpose cocktail party summary when it comes to motivation there s a gap between what science knows and what business does our current business operating system which is built around external carrot and stick motivators doesn t work and often does harm we need an upgrade and the science shows the way this new approach has three essential elements 1 autonomy the desire to direct our own lives 2 mastery the urge to get better and better at something that matters and 3 purpose the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves drive chapter by chapter summary introduction the puzzling puzzles of harry harlow and edward deci human beings have a biological drive that includes hunger thirst and sex we also have another long recognized drive to respond to rewards and punishments in our environment but in the middle of the twentieth century a few scientists began discovering that humans also have a third drive what some call intrinsic motivation for several decades behavioral scientists have been figuring out the dynamics and explaining the power of our third drive alas business hasn t caught up to this new understanding if we want to strengthen our companies elevate our lives and improve the world we need to close the gap between what science knows and what business does part one a new operating system chapter 1 the rise and fall of motivation 2 0 societies like computers have operating systems a set of mostly invisible instructions and protocols on which everything runs the first human operating system call it motivation 1 0 was all about survival its successor motivation 2 0 was built around external rewards and punishments that worked fine for routine twentieth century tasks but in the twenty first century motivation 2 0 is proving incompatible with how we organize what we do how we think about what we do and how we do what we do we need an upgrade chapter 2 seven reasons carrots and sticks often don t work when carrots and sticks encounter our third drive strange things begin to happen traditional if then rewards can give us less of what we want they can extinguish intrinsic motivation diminish performance crush creativity and crowd out good behavior they can also give us more of what we don t want they can encourage unethical behavior create addictions and foster short term thinking these are the bugs in our current operating system chapter 2a and the special circumstances when they do carrots and sticks aren t all bad they can be effective for rule based routine tasks because there s little intrinsic motivation to undermine and not much creativity to crush and they can be more effective still if those giving such rewards offer a rationale for why the task is necessary acknowledge that it s boring and allow people autonomy over how they complete it for nonroutine conceptual tasks rewards are more perilous particularly those of the if then variety but now that rewards noncontingent rewards given after a task is complete can sometimes be okay for more creative right brain work especially if they provide useful information about performance chapter 3 type i and type x motivation 2 0 depended on and fostered type x behavior behavior fueled more by extrinsic desires than intrinsic ones and concerned less with the inherent satisfaction of an activity and more with the external rewards to which an activity leads motivation 3 0 the upgrade that s necessary for the smooth functioning of twenty first century business depends on and fosters type i behavior type i behavior concerns itself less with the external rewards an activity brings and more with the inherent satisfaction of the activity itself for professional success and personal fulfillment we need to move ourselves and our colleagues from type x to type i the good news is that type i s are made not born and type i behavior leads to stronger performance greater health and higher overall well being part two the three elements chapter 4 autonomy our default setting is to be autonomous and self directed unfortunately circumstances including outdated notions of management often conspire to change that default setting and turn us from type i to type x to encourage type i behavior and the high performance it enables the first requirement is autonomy people need autonomy over task what they do time when they do it team who they do it with and technique how they do it companies that offer autonomy sometimes in radical doses are outperforming their competitors chapter 5 mastery while motivation 2 0 required compliance motivation 3 0 demands engagement only engagement can produce mastery becoming better at something that matters and the pursuit of mastery an important but often dormant part of our third drive has become essential to making one s way in the economy mastery begins with flow optimal experiences when the challenges we face are exquisitely matched to our abilities smart workplaces therefore supplement day to day activities with goldilocks tasks not too hard and not too easy but mastery also abides by three peculiar rules mastery is a mindset it requires the capacity to see your abilities not as finite but as infinitely improvable mastery is a pain it demands effort grit and deliberate practice and mastery is an asymptote it s impossible to fully realize which makes it simultaneously frustrating and alluring chapter 6 purpose humans by their nature seek purpose a cause greater and more enduring than themselves but traditional businesses have long considered purpose ornamental a perfectly nice accessory so long as it didn t get in the way of the important things but that s changing thanks in part to the rising tide of aging baby boomers reckoning with their own mortality in motivation 3 0 purpose maximization is taking its place alongside profit maximization as an aspiration and a guiding principle within organizations this new purpose motive is expressing itself in three ways in goals that use profit to reach purpose in words that emphasize more than self interest and in policies that allow people to pursue purpose on their own terms this move to accompany profit maximization with purpose maximization has the potential to rejuvenate our businesses and remake our world drive ',\n",

what if this is one of life s laws that each and every human being lives with it is just like any other universal law for the facts that there is no way to avoid it and there is no way of changing it it simply is what it is there is one way however that the law of attraction differs from all the others the law of attraction is the one and only universal law that we have the ability to control we live in a world of cause and effect with each thought and emotion that we have there is an effect to it there are two ways that we can use our thoughts the first is that we can use them uncontrollably

specific techniques on how to use the law of attraction effectively and efficiently so that you can create your world exactly as you please something was missing but what before we get started on learning about the law of i would first like to tell you the story of how i have come to learn of the law of attraction i have added this and other interesting stories that pertain to the loa because i personally believe they can be useful for you to hear hearing these stories will help give you a better understanding of how the law of attraction really works this story in particular is a perfect example actually it was my subconsciously using the law of attraction that brought the law of attraction into my life i have always had a relationship with god or so i thought before discovering the law of attraction i had always talked to god on a daily basis i honestly thought that i had a great relationship with him and that our relationship was complete i didn t know at the time that my relationship with him could have been so much more than what it was what i didn t realize was that most of the times that i talked to god was when i really needed or wanted something from him i was thankful for things that i had but i wasn t necessarily always thankful for everything good in my life i realize now that the relationship i had with god was nothing compared to what it could have or should have been my gratitude toward him for what i had was true and real but that too only went so far i was thankful to god for when things went well yet i paid little attention to those blessings when things went amiss in my life i didn t blame god for the difficult times but i would forget to focus on my blessings that i did still have looking back it s no wonder that about 2 years ago when i was 35 i felt something was missing from my life i had a great husband three beautiful daughters and a nice home i had pretty much everything i needed to make me happy still i felt there was more out there that could fulfill my life to a much fuller satisfaction back then i thought it was religion that was missing i grew up believing in god but i never had any specific religion and i certainly didn t go to church growing up as and adult i tried visiting many different churches but never found a religion that i felt was right for my family and i then one day there was a knock on my door it was jehovah s witnesses again as this was only one of many times that these two ladies had visited my home if it were my husband who had answered the door these nice people would have automatically received a door slammed in their face i on the other hand have always been very open minded most of the time i would spare a bit of my time and listen to what they have to say i knew for a fact that i did not want to be a jehovah s witness i don t have the same beliefs as they do and sometimes i even had my own little debates with these ladies over what i believe and what their bible says i always had my own strong beliefs that i thought were good and right but even though i believed i was living my life in good standards i knew still that something was missing on this day i had my little chat with the two ladies as i sometimes did now looking back it was a very good thing that i answered the door that day and not my husband i say this because my little chat with these two ladies changed my life forever if you are wondering if i have become a jehovah s witness the answer is no that s not what happened i explained to them that i had no idea what kind of religion i was looking for but it definitely wasn t jehovah s witness then one of the women said to me ask god ask him what it is you are seeking and he will show it to you okay well she didn t say ask god exactly she said ask jehovah so i said alright i will when the two ladies left and i did just that i asked god lord i am missing something from my life but i don t know what it is is it religion if so what religion is best for me please help me find the answers i seek i asked god this several times a day for 3 days i would ask him the same thing every time not always in the same words exactly but you get the idea then on the 4th day i was on netflix guess what i came across the movie the secret once i watched the movie i knew that this was the answer i had been waiting for god had answered my prayer i began to watch the movie over and over again i just couldn t believe that the secret to life was really this simple i had to know more and so i began reading books about the law of attraction as well this was exactly what i was looking for it wasn t a religion it was simply an entirely different way of living it was a positive way of thinking and loving and living life to it s fullest potential it wasn t just praying it was the way to building my own very special bond with god or any higher being for that matter so that when i talked to him i could actually understand him when he spoke back to me as well no i m not crazy and i don t hear voices okay if you ask my husband he ll tell you i can be little crazy at times but not that kind of crazy it s a different kind of hearing and understanding god on a deeper level where we pay closer attention to the signs in our surroundings and listen with our hearts not our ears living by default when i started applying the law of attraction to my life on a daily basis everything in my life started to go my way all the time life just simply got better my relationship with my teenage daughter got better i saw major improvements in my skin and weight i had all the energy in the world even the little things in life would always go my way i honestly felt like i was high all the time high on life the intensity of this high feeling will depend on how strongly a person applies the loa to their life for some it may be a mild feeling of a bit more happiness than they are used to for others who use it to the fullest extent it literally can feel like you have been placed into another world everything and everyone is exceptionally beautiful it can feel as though you are in an out of body experience at times for me this is metaphorically speaking but i have heard of cases where people meditated in such a profound manner that this has actually happened or at least the person felt it and thought it actually happened you may feel a heightened awareness of everything around you for those who use this universal law to its fullest potential they will see colors become more vivid animal lovers may notice that they see animals more often and that the animals come closer than usual some people may actually be able to feel their own vibes they are giving off into the world and understand exactly why all these animals are coming around most people will find themselves making fewer mistakes and having fewer accidents this is something i paid extra close attention to when i began using the law of attraction as you ll learn from this book no matter how strongly you are positively using this law you will still have negative thoughts every now and then these negative thoughts are manageable but not completely unavoidable what i found is when i have a negative thought i will experience some kind of small accident or i would make a little mistake of some kind for instance if all of a sudden i think of something negative i will end up spilling something on myself or i ll stub my toe when these things happen i take notice of what it was i was thinking about at the time or shortly prior to the accident about 95 of the time my accidents happen as i m having a negative thought or shortly after i use these mistakes and accidents as a reminder to myself that my thoughts are not in line with what i want realizing this helps me to make a change and start thinking in a more positive way the law of attraction works best when we use it towards specific things however when you begin using it with full force it begins to work with everything else in your life even without even trying you will notice the law of attraction working very effectively for everything you think about good or bad without any intention at all a good example of this is the day my husband came home from work early my husband never comes home early but one day when i was using the law of attraction in full force i said to myself wouldn t it be great if he came home early today that day was the first time in about 2 years that he actually came home early i wasn t focusing on it i had no reason to focus on it because the likelihood of it actually happening wasn t worth my efforts it was just a quick thought that passed through my mind and that was all it took because i was using the loa all day every day and for everything the universe had become so accustomed to giving me what i wanted that i even got what i wanted with little to no effort put into it this may seem like small potatoes but if you knew my husbands work habits you might not think so also because of his work habits it was a very odd thought for me to have had to begin with any other day it would have taken the building to burn down for my husband to come home early but no the building was still standing and yet my husband still came home early as i said when i began using the law of attraction everything went my way when i got in my car i just new i would hit all green lights while driving and that s exactly what happened i rarely sat at a red light every time i turned on the radio the song playing would be one that i was just thinking about or the lyrics of the song would completely pertain to specific things that were happening in my life at the time yes i know these coincidences happen to everyone but they are not really coincidences at all there is no such thing as a coincidence everything we view as such is simply the law of attraction at work the law of attraction is working with every thought you have whether you realize it or not the more you deliberately use the law of attraction to your benefit the more of these coincidences you will see you will see them happen all around you from the moment you wake up till you go to bed at night it really does start to feel like you re in the twilight zone quite literally they mention something to this effect in the movie the secret and it is 100 accurate once i learned how to use the loa i wasn t living my life by default anymore i knew how to use the law of attraction i understood with full belief that everything that happens in our lives we are subconsciously bringing upon ourselves most people who don t understand this are living their lives by default this means they don t understand what the law of attraction is or they don t believe in it these people just keep living from day to day thinking sometimes we have good luck and sometimes we have bad luck or we play the cards we are dealt they lack the understanding that we all make our own luck as a result of the way we think and feel people think that what happens to us is the luck of the draw they don t understand that we can put those five cards back and pick up four aces and a king if we so choose unfortunately too many people who live in this manner end up with many more trouble in their lives than those using the law of attraction to their benefit many people don t have naturally positive attitudes and as a result they end up with very few comforts in their lives these people then become even more miserable due to their unfortunate circumstances which they have actually been causing themselves without even realizing it these people believe that their unhappiness is due to lack of luck or uncontrollable and unfortunate circumstances not of their own doing they have no idea that by controlling the way we think and feel we can deliberately create what ever we want in life people living on the streets can one day own a multi million dollar business someday if they could only learn to control their thinking patterns and emotions some people are positive thinkers naturally if you are not deliberately using the law of attraction but you are one of these people who naturally carry positive attitudes and emotions you will probably still end up with what you want you will still be living your life by default but by default or not the law of attraction is still at work because of your positivity the loa is automatically working for you in a positive way your positive attitude is bringing about good things into your life whether you believe in the law of attraction or not if you wholeheartedly believe that happiness and prosperity will be yours then even by default it will be yours next time you re out and about whether at the grocery store the mall a park or anywhere there might be a lot of people take notice of those around you watch them you can actually identify the people who either use the law of attraction in a positive way or naturally carry with them good positive natured attitudes these people hold their heads up high they smile and they have a positive aura which makes you want to be near them they will usually be dressed nicely and drive nice cars you will see they are polite and cordial to others you may come across people who have two of those items dressed nicely and the car but you will still be able to notice whether or not they are using positivity to get those things if they don t have that aura smile and friendly attitude unfortunately it wouldn t be surprising if one day all their financial blessings disappeared for that s what happens to most well to do people with negative thoughts and attitudes these people either gained what they have by inheritance or by being unethical or cheating some of these people have gotten to where they are by being good honest and positive people at some point in their lives unfortunately though if their attitude has changed since then and that positivity is not what you are seeing in that person now it is inevitable that their wealth will not last unless they revert back to the goodness that helped them to get to where they are in the first place i d like to talk to you a moment about wealth wealth isn t only by financial means when i say it is inevitable that their wealth won t last i mean all different types of wealth maybe these negative people will live and die with financial wealth in the bank while still maintaining their negative attitudes but that doesn t mean that they will maintain a wealthy life as a whole i have always thought the actions of men the best interpreters of their thoughts john locke god created us and this world with one thing in mind our happiness he wants us all to be content and satisfied with the life he has given us his intention is for us all to live a life of luxury these luxuries include health happiness love satisfaction contentment good finances and anything else you would like to add to that list god has made this world work in such a way that we are all able to have what ever it is that we want that s why the universe is endless and filled with endless energy as well that energy that the universe is filled with is our never ending supply of happiness for every human on earth god has also given us another gift he gave us free will the meaning of free will isn t only about the choices we make when it comes to what we do it s also the gift of choosing our thoughts with this free will and the never ending space of energy that we have been given to create with we have the power to make magic happen that is why they say that we are made in the likeness of god this idea works without believing in god as well whatever it is you believe in god buddha the gods of hinduism the universe it all works in the same way we as people are not happy because we have things we have things because we are happy this leads me to another important thing that i want you to understand it is okay to want things there is nothing wrong with wanting more in your life what is wrong though is when you are not happy when you don t have it wanting things and needing them in order to be happy are two very different things feeling that you need something in order to be happy will always prevent you from acquiring your desires here are a couple little stories about wanting things i used to know someone who claimed he didn t need much in life we ll call this person john doe john doe was happy with the bare minimum in fact he was supposedly so satisfied with having nothing that he would talk about others in a negative way for wanting too much if he came across someone who wanted things or even people who already had things he would call them money hungry john doe couldn t keep a job every time he got one he would sabotage the job because he thought the position in the company he was given was unfair he believed that because he was an assistant manager at one of his prior jobs he should get the same position at his new job when john was hired at entry levels he would become bitter and unsatisfied because of this he would get into arguments with the managers or call in sick until he was fired or he would simply quit without notice needless to say john didn t have much he had a negative outlook on people he always had an excuse of why he couldn t do something and he believed this world treated him unfairly now it s about 16 years later and not much has changed john doe is going on 40 years old and he still lives with his father he doesn t have a job he is on welfare he doesn t have a driver s license a car or a bank account it s very unfortunate but his thoughts and actions have kept him in this position which is exactly what he always claimed to have wanted the reason john doe doesn t have much in his life isn t really because he never wanted it everyone wants things we re human it s natural for us to want things no he doesn t have things because deep down he felt he either couldn t get the things he wanted and so it was easier just to give up on any hopes for them or he didn t feel he deserved them in reality neither of these ideas he had were true john could have had so much more he deserved so much more if he had only seen the possibilities before him and believed in his ability to achieve them he would be living a completely different existence right now but he saw money as a bad thing people who had it were selfish people who had it only cared about one thing money itself because he focused on how unfair life was and because he focused on all the excuses of why he couldn t do something he got all that returned to him even now if someone tells him of job opportunities his one answer is how can i get a job when i don t have a car if you mention the bus his answer is how can i buy a bus pass when i don t have any money he never understood where there is a will to do something there is a way john doe isn t the only person i know who had similar thoughts as his i myself felt for a long time that i couldn t do much either the only job experience i had was in retail restaurants or childcare after having my last two children i didn t want to go into childcare again and it made no sense to get a retail or restaurant job because i would pay out more money for childcare for my kids than i would bring in because i never saw my own potential to do more i would simply tell everyone i was happy just staying home i would say that i didn t need more than what my husband was bringing in i was lying to my whole family but most of all i was lying to myself the truth was i would have loved to bring in some income i would have loved to be able to go out shopping and actually pay with my own money money i earned myself but being 36 years old and completely unaware of my skills i had no idea that i was capable of it first of all i was embarrassed for not having done anything with myself by now because of this if i were to have tried something and failed to me it would have made my failure look even worse so there is another excuse to not even try and my reasons for not trying just keep going around and around but if i were really honest with myself i would say that my excuses were just that excuses i used to be very much like john doe at some point in my life i learned that i would not be able to get the things i wanted in life i learned and believed that i wouldn t become successful so why bother it was easier for me to just give up and save the time trouble and embarrassment i was one of the lucky ones too many people live this way and never learn the truth thankfully i learned exactly how capable i am of anything i want to achieve in life once i learned this i decided i wanted more i saw my possibilities in front of me i acknowledged the challenges i believed i could do it and i began making things happen had i continued believing that i was fine with wanting nothing i would have never had it in me to become an author now here i am earning full time income writing another one of my goals was to teach others to believe in themselves and show them how to achieve their goals it can be done i don t care how old you are if you re still kicking you still have time if we want great things we have to ask for them first if we want a lot of things then we have to ask for those things first once someone does learn about the loa they might want to do what i did jump in headfirst that s awesome as long as they are also willing to learn all they can about it as well as you ll learn from this book if someone doesn t learn about all the little things that go into the loa then diving in headfirst is really a big waste of time i have given you these stories to show you that again it is okay to want things it doesn t mean you are greedy or money hungry it simply means that you want for yourself the exact same thing that the universe or god wants for you if you act as though you don t want things you are limiting yourself and your potential i am also using this as an example of what happens when we don t go after what we want and that is nothing nothing happens unless we make it happen want what you want and don t be upset if you don t have it yet be grateful for every little thing that you do have even if the only thing to be grateful for is the air you breathe be grateful for that when it comes to selling books if you only sell one book in a month be grateful for that sale in addition know that with this attitude you will one day have the things you want and then some positive thinking positive thinking absolutely works but the law of attraction is so much more than that there are many other steps involved aside from simple positive thinking positive thinking is kind of like the shell of a car you have the base outline but you still need the motor the wheels the transmission and everything else a car needs in order to get you from a to b we will get to all the other components of how to get the law of attraction up and running properly but for now i want to keep things simple if you decide to put the law of attraction to action and it by chance doesn t work the way you had hoped what harm will it have done by simply giving it a try you will only be exactly where you were before you tried it that s another of the many great things about this by trying out the loa there is never anything to lose but a whole lot to gain money success career these are the number one reasons people begin using the loa but as said earlier there is so much more that it can do for you it can help us with our self confidence it can help us heal our emotional and physical ailments it can help us with school grades making friends raising our children making you better looking you name it and the law of attraction can help you with it every single thing that happens in this world and in our personal lives are all products of how we think and feel this means that everything that happens whether good or bad are all based on our very own thoughts even if it s something that has been done to you it was still your own thoughts and emotions that caused the other person to do it if it was something that happened to you it was still your own thoughts and emotions that caused it to happen how is your own thought process be honest take a good evaluation of yourself and how you tend to view situations take a look around you and evaluate how much you have achieved compared to how much you would like to achieve are you where you had always hoped you would be by now in your life if not what do think is holding you back luckily there is good news if you are unsatisfied with your current situation know that your current situation is only the outcome of what you were thinking and feeling in the past it has nothing to do with what you are thinking and feeling at this very moment this means that if you start today and begin turning your negative thoughts and feelings into positive ones you can reap the rewards of doing so in the future there is no telling how long it will take for you to start seeing changes in your luck due to the changes in your thinking habits depending on how drastically and quickly you are able to turn around your thought process you could see changes in your luck in the next 5 minutes or the next 5 days it s all up to you we are in control of our own destiny if your kids are sick and you keep saying to yourself that s it now i m going to get sick i just know it guess what you re going to get sick but if you think i don t get sick i m always healthy i have a great immune system and i ll be fine then guess what you ll be fine a good example of this is how my husband and i differ in this thought process my husband is always deathly afraid when any of our kids get sick this is understandable because he always gets sick right after them i on the other hand never get sick if you think to yourself i ll never own my own home i have horrible credit it s impossible it ll never happen you will most likely never own that home or get your credit straightened out it all depends on how often and how long you have been thinking in this way and with how much emotion you have been putting into these thoughts if for 40 years you say to yourself that you will never own a home then during those 40 years you won t own that home but even then it s not too late the very day you start truly believing that you will own a home is the very day that owning your home becomes a possibility even after 40 years of negative thinking patterns you can still own that home when you begin to apply the law of attraction to your life in a positive way the reason i use the words use the law of attraction in a positive way is because whether we realize it or not we are all using the law of every single second of our lives you can t stop it every moment your brain is thinking the law of attraction is working the question is how do you want to use it these are your choices you can use the law of attraction deliberately and positively deliberately and negatively completely by default you make the choice or the law of attraction will choose for you truly believing or wishful thinking with all the success people have had using the loa it still surprises me that so many people think it s all bologna but after talking to people about it i have come to understand why that is the biggest problems with the law of attraction not working for people are due to these 3 things 1 most people don t actually believe with all of their heart and soul the law of attraction to be true believing in it whole heartedly is absolutely necessary for it to work 2 people who do believe in it don t have a full understanding of how it works there are specific things that play a very large role in how it works what s more than that people may know what these things are but are not grasping the concept of how to properly use them 3 the people that do completely believe in the loa simply don t know how to see or recognize the answers to their requests or questions when those answers are shown to them not recognizing the answers the universe puts in front of you prevents the actions we must take to attaining our goal in this book i vow to do my best to show you how to identify when god or the universe is talking to you and how to understand what it is he is trying to convey most people who have tried the law of attraction think of only the basic steps asking believing visualizing and receiving then when they try these simple steps of course it doesn t work doing it this way people usually only see some small results they might notice more coincidences than usual or they seem to get a bit closer to their goals however because they did not follow all of the instructions in their most specific forms these people never fully received what they wanted i know that so many people truly want to believe and some honestly think that they do believe in the law of attraction but in reality they don t maybe they want to believe in it because they have seen the law of attraction work for others or maybe they are just open minded people maybe some of these people have even seen it work for them themselves but they chocked it up to coincidence when their larger dreams didn t manifest but subconsciously somewhere in their hearts they have their doubts as long as those doubts remain it won t matter how much someone wants to truly believe in the law of attraction it will simply never workout for them this way and then there are the people like my husband who think that wishing and hoping is the same as believing my husband always says that he believes that the loa works unfortunately along with those words there is always a contradiction with the statement for instance my husband complains a lot about not being able to save money and about his long commute to work when he complains about money i remind him of the law of attraction and point out to him that the complaining he is doing is only causing more money saving problems for him overall my husband is a happy person despite his commute and money saving issues he is a joy to be around and he really knows how to make people laugh the kids love him to death and he gives them all the attention they need when he gets home it s just a few certain things that bother him but when they do he dwells on them dwelling on a problem is the absolute worst thing you can do when my husband pays the bills he actually allows his stomach to get upset over it it s true he tells me so there is no reason that anyone should allow himself to feel this way about anything always remember the more emotion you put into a thought the faster that thought comes true this includes all the things you are unhappy or nervous about what s more if it s already true the situation will just get worse it s not fun paying bills i know but always try to do your best not to dwell or allow yourself to get upset about it you will have to pay the bill anyway so really there is no point in getting upset over it it s not going to change your circumstances if you feel yourself getting upset over it just start thinking about how thankful for the service or item you received that you are paying the bill for if you are paying an extra large electricity bill and you begin feeling angry that the bill is so high try and think to yourself well at least we have electricity i am thankful that we at least have that and if you have the money to pay that bill think to yourself i sure am thankful that i can pay this bill so that we can keep enjoying the electricity that we have i have also heard of people writing the words thank you for services rendered or what ever the service was provided they write it on the bill put it in the envelope with the check and send it off there is a psychology to this which we will get to a bit later when we discuss gratitude i will be the first person to agree that my husband has a hard life he has to commute sometimes 4 hours of driving a day then he works 8 10 hours of hard physical labor when he comes home every night from another long drive he walks into a house with 3 kids who desperately need his attention all the poor guy wants to do is fall asleep on the couch yes his life is very difficult but it doesn t have to be that way i try and tell him that we can move closer to his work it is absolutely possible he has better credit than anyone i have ever met and we own our home there are definitely ways to do it but all he keeps saying is we can t move closer it s impossible i don t want to have a larger mortgage i don t have this i don t have that blah blah blah i have come up with several plans on how we can move closer but of course my husband will always come up with something wrong with the plan instead of saying i don t have the money he should be saying when we have the money we ll move and it will be great if you think you can or if you think you can t either way you are right henry ford i love my husband he is the best man i know he has a great job he brings in great money and he works harder than anyone i know but if he really wants to be promoted then he needs to stop saying that he never will be if he wants to move closer to work then he needs to start saying that it will happen in due time it is only when he begins to focus on these positive outcomes that these things will begin to go his way sometimes when my husband comes home to me he says boy you sure have a great life don t you he says this in a joking manner of course i just put up my feet smile and say to him why yes i do when using the law of attraction you must find the bright side to every given situation and yes there is a bright side to every given situation as i said my husband hates his commute i tell him that he should get some audio books or listen to the radio do you know what he listens to when driving home he listens to talk shows about money and the economy it s no wonder he hates his commute so much i try and tell him to focus on the fact that at least he has some down time before he gets home to us he should try and think of it as his break before he gets home and has to work again always looking on the bright side takes practice and training and repetition but it s a very doable thing many people are hard workers and have high goals and aspirations some people have big hopes and dreams and are wishful thinkers these are great qualities to have but it s not what true believing really is hoping and wishing is not what the law of attraction is about in fact it s quite the opposite when using the loa correctly you cannot hope for something to happen you have to know that it s going to happen holding onto dreams is an absolute must in order to bring them about into your life but many people who hold on to their dreams also hold onto something else they also hold onto all the reasons their dreams won t come true what i mean by this is that they dream but they also constantly keep in mind that it hasn t happened yet and also all the reasons it hasn t happened yet many of these people have the idea in their head that simply having high hopes and desires is using the law of attraction right there they are missing the whole point it is never a bad thing to be a wishful thinker but that is not going to bring you closer to your goals wishing and knowing are two different things another thing that will for sure hold you back from achieving your goals is pessimism if you are living your life by murphy s law everything that can go wrong will go wrong then guess what by default that is exactly what is going to happen for you pessimism and the loa are on two opposite ends of the field try and remove any pessimism from your life you will be amazed at the results you will see just by applying this one simple gesture it is impossible to be pessimistic and believe in the law of attraction at the same time believing is the key to everything in life if you want to become a successful at anything then you must absolutely believe and know for a fact that you will achieve it everything that we know will happen for a fact will happen for a fact you may be someone who really wants to believe in the law of attraction but still have your doubts you may find that there are moments that you really do honestly believe in it and then there are moments that you don t if you really want to believe in the loa then use the loa to help you to believe and remove your doubts take those small moments that you do believe and run with them during those moments that you find yourself believing in it get excited about it and thank the universe for helping you to believe in the law of attraction at that moment everyone has doubts every now and then not necessarily about whether the law of attraction works or not but sometimes even when knowing that it works we can still have doubts about whether we can make our dreams come true this is natural especially if you are just beginning to use the law of attraction use the law of attraction to help you to believe in it and your dreams to a greater extent when you find yourself in a moment of full faith be thankful for that moment and then ask the universe to help you to believe in it in this way more often you will find yourself slowly beginning to have more and more faith in it as time goes on and the more faith you have in it the better it works in fulfilling your dreams only do this during the moments that you find yourself truly believing in it don t do it during moments that you are feeling in doubt you can t trick the universe if you try and thank the universe for helping you have more faith in the loa during a moment that you are actually doubting it those doubts will shine brighter than the northern star and in return you will keep feeling more doubt e mc2 what does e mc2 mean through science most of us know that this entire universe is made up of energy it is one big ball of endless energy albert einstein came up with the relativity equation of e mc2 e is energy m is mass and c is the speed of light the 2 simply mean s that the speed of light is squared simply put energy turns into mass scientists have now proven that even our thoughts and emotions are energy too again what does energy turn into mass what is mass mass is things so how does this energy our thoughts turn into reality the earth s atmosphere may only be so big but god has given us so much more than just the earth s atmosphere he has given us endless amounts of space that goes on for eternity this space is an endless supply of possibilities lets clarify that a bit when we look into outer space we see the planets the moon the sun and the stars yes there is more out there but lets keep this simple what do we see in between all of those things we see nothing just empty black space but that nothing is actually something every single bit of this blackness that we see out there is actually filled with vibrating probability waves or ether this ether is where every single thing in this universe starts out into physical form these waves are energy just like everything else that we can see and touch and everything that we cannot see and touch like thought sound and feelings for these things that we cannot see and touch are energy too we call these vibrating waves probability waves because they start out as energy that is probable to turn into anything we decide them to be but will not become something until a thought is sent out into the universe to get it started the very moment you have a thought is the exact moment in which that thought becomes something the second your thought is sent out into the ether it becomes a tiny particle in space this is the very beginning of your thought being created into reality once your thought hits the ether it becomes an actual physical and touchable reality when the object of your thought has been created into this tiny form it s up to you to move closer to it and as you do it continues to grow into its fullest form of your desire keep in mind that it s not only things that work in this way situations and circumstances are energy too basically every single thing and every single thing that happens is made up of energy whether visible or not if you have a certain something that you would like to happen in your life other than acquiring monetary objects or people the law of attraction will work for that as well for instance finding your soul mate learning to speed read or getting better at a certain talent or sport okay so that s great and all all i do is think of something i want and then it exists good great grand but how do i actually get it or how do i actually make it happen in order to attract what you want you must get your own energy vibrating on the same level as the vibration of what it is you desire i ve been talking about thoughts just like your thoughts are what create that tiny little particle of your objects of affection in the first place it is also our thoughts that get our energy vibrating on the same level of that object bringing us closer to it unfortunately though it s not quite so simple in order for your thought to actually be sent out into the universe the thought must come from your subconscious mind we all have a conscious and a subconscious mind your conscious mind is what you use to do everyday things it can tell time read books do math and make everyday decisions your subconscious mind is where you hold your long term memories and feelings it cannot tell time it is not what you are thinking but what you are feeling your subconscious mind is basically what you feel in your heart you must get your subconscious mind or your heart to work with your conscious mind in order to send the thoughts you want out into the universe you do that through visualization and we will get to that shortly do you pray if your answer is no then i m here to tell you re wrong we all pray whether we realize it or not every single thought you have is a prayer whether the thought is something you want or something you don t want your thoughts are prayers that are being sent out into the universe constantly our thoughts never stop not even at night when we re dreaming even when you feel like you re in some kind of a daze you are still thinking our minds just keep going and going and going like the energizer bunny as long as our thoughts are going we are praying there are a few very important details to this part of the law of attraction that you must fully understand first of all the universe cannot differentiate the difference from a good thought or a bad thought it doesn t understand whether your thought is something you want or something you don t want because of this using the words i want or i don t want are pointless if you are thinking i don t want to lose my job the universe doesn t hear the i don t want part of the statement all it is hearing is the losing your job part another thing is the universe doesn t have ears you need to understand that anything you say out loud will not be heard if for a whole year you keep saying out loud i want my boss to give me a raise this year but in your head you keep thinking i m not going to get a raise this year guess what you re not going to get that raise god didn t hear a word you said but he heard everything you thought ask and you shall receive recognize what it is you re truly thinking and feeling be fully aware that with every thought you have it is actually you asking for something from the universe and know that your prayers are being heard every moment of your life the universe wants to give you what you want so make it clear and ask for only positive things by focusing on only those positive things in other words be careful of what you wish for once you have put a positive thought or energy out into the world and the creation of it has begun how do you actually get it acquiring what you want depends on these things ask asking for what you want your thoughts and emotions your gratitude for all that you have now and for all the things you are going to have believing having full faith that you will have what you desire your visualization sessions following your intuition taking action letting it go detach yourself from what you want we will be going over all of these things in the coming chapters you ll need to understand them well in order to get yourself closer to your goals but before we get into the specifics on this list you should first take a good look at what it is you are asking for and make sure it is your true hearts desire this means that what you ask for must be something that you are willing to do almost anything to get because that is how bad you want it how do you know if something is your true hearts desire or not if you can make up excuses or reasons for why you might not get it that s a sign that you don t want it bad enough that is not a true hearts desire a true hearts desire has no excuses we will get it and we know that we will get it no matter what it takes a true hearts desire is something you want with your body and mind but it s also something you desire with your soul have you ever wanted something so bad that you just knew in your heart without a shadow of a doubt that you would make it happen that is how you must feel about writing as a career that s how i felt when i first decided to self publish my first book i was so excited about it that i wrote my second third and fourth book before the illustrations to the first one were even finished not everyone shared my enthusiasm i was spending a lot of money on the illustrations for my first book and my husband was nervous about it i kept telling him that i just knew this was supposed to happen for me i knew it in my gut that my books were going to do well and that i was doing all the right things to make that happen i felt this with all of my heart and nothing was going to stop me now try and stay with me the next few paragraphs are a bit tricky reread them if you need to some of you might be thinking but jenny maybe your subconscious mind only knew your books would do well because your destiny was preordained for it to go that way maybe you automatically knew it because your subconscious mind was merely telling you what was going to happen anyway you are right about one thing it was my subconscious mind that put those positive thoughts there however it wasn t because my books were destined to well just like everything else in life the success of my books could have gone either way even now they still can you see i don t have any preordained destiny of what is supposed to automatically happen to me and neither do you we all create our own destiny in our lives as we go along i didn t know my books were going to do well just because it was already in the cards for me it was the other way around i had to first believe in the success of my books before the destiny of it was created so why did i feel so strongly that my books would be successful to begin with how and why did i just know that my books would be successful i knew because it was my true hearts desire for them to be successful when something is a true hearts desire we subconsciously know that we will do what ever it takes to make it happen because the success of my books was my true hearts desire my subconscious mind already knew that i would accept nothing less and so it continuously gave me the feeling of absolute certainty that it would happen i was right my books did do well they did very well because i wanted it wholeheartedly and therefore subconsciously i knew it would happen i wanted it enough that i wasn t going to allow anything to stand in my way this is how you must feel about all the goals you set for yourself get yourself on that level successful people have passion for what they want with passion come the perseverance persistence determination drive motivation and inspiration to get what one wants when you have passion for something then it is a true hearts desire it s only things you feel this strongly about that you should focus on making happen if you ask for something you don t feel this way about then you could be wasting your time and energy if this is the case you might be better off putting your energy into something you really do want i hope i explained myself well and you didn t need to reread too much but there is one more thing i would like to be understood i have made it clear i don t personally believe in any preordained plan for us however i do believe we have a purpose and that is much different than a plan every single thing that is put here on this planet has a purpose a reason for having been created i believe god gave us a purpose without a plan then he threw us down here onto his little board game of life and now it s up to us to figure out what our purpose is and how to best fulfill it the sooner you begin living for your purpose in life the better when you are living for your purpose you will naturally become a happier individual you will automatically begin living your life in line with the universe you ll be in a much better position to send out the correct messages of what you want your vibrating frequency will be more gracefully in tune with the vibrating frequencies of the things you want bringing them to you faster once you find your purpose you will find that the energy surrounding you will become more harmonious you will feel you yourself are also in better alignment with the universe and all the things you want the universe is trying to bring you the things you want and you are keeping your energies open to accept these gifts your life s purpose doesn t have to be difficult too many people stress themselves out searching for something that sounds inspiring or poetic most of us have unrealistic expectations as to what we think our purpose should be we as individuals aren t meant to fix the whole world on our own don t get me wrong it s not completely impossible that your purpose might be that you are a super hero but the chances of it are so unlikely it would go against your best interest to ignore all your other probable callings just for the sake that you might need to save the world someday finding your real purpose is a lot easier than it sounds and it s could be extremely beneficial to you and your success here are a few things that might help you find your calling when you are trying to figure out what your calling is the first thing you need to do is throw everything you know about money or currency out the window you need to try and pretend you don t even know what money is the second thing you need to do is figure out what you re passionate about your passion and your purpose will go hand in hand you will not be able to find your purpose until you know what you are passionate about so how do you know what you re passionate about answer some of these questions if you can t think of what you might be passionate about right now in your life try looking back on when you were a kid your childhood is where you will find you had the most passion if you can t think of something you were passionate about try thinking of something you were good at you might even try that with your current situation sometimes if something is work we ll claim to not enjoy it simply because it s work sometimes we re on autopilot and really don t give much thought to it at all just think of something you re good at and really analyze it you may find that it s actually your passion disguised as work what were some things you loved to do when you were a kid if you could pick one service you could do for others instead of monetary payments for general living expenses what would it be now you need to take your passions the things that you love to do and brainstorm really though if you just ask god to tell you what your passion is he will tell you and by the time you are finished reading this book you should be able to read the answers he gives you one important thing to remember is that most of the time a true purpose is a type of service or help to others yet you enjoy it so much you can easily forget you are the one who is doing the servicing to you it feels as though it s the other way around you are getting the much better end of the stick when you follow your calling it is always something that either pays you in some kind of currency or you will be financially taken care of in some other way god doesn t send us here to do for others and have no way of having our own basic needs met if you have no way to eat and nowhere to sleep then that is a sign you are heading down the wrong path but really that s the wonderful thing about following your calling in life usually these are things most people don t ever have to deal with the people who follow their calling are the ones who have fewer troubles financially and emotionally they are the ones who seem to be sailing through life without a care in the world that s because that is exactly how they feel happy without a care in the world visualizing visualizing what you want is the electricity in which ignites the power within you to physically move your dreams into reality one can only receive what he wants when he can see it actually happening if you desire success use the power of visualization to force your body into the actions needed in order to bring that success into your circumstances this is not as easy as it might sound as i said before your desire must be sent out into the universe by your subconscious mind to do this you first need to get your conscious mind to work it s way into your subconscious mind simply visualizing what you want isn t enough to make your dreams come true your subconscious mind does not feel exactly what it is your conscious brain is thinking but you need it to for this work luckily there are ways to force your subconscious into submission there are certain things that you must add to your visualizing in order force your subconscious mind to work in harmony with your conscious to me it s kind of like brain washing your subconscious mind with your conscious mind most books you read on visualization say that you need to find somewhere quiet to meditate personally this didn t work for me i have never been one to meditate so for me if it was quiet my visualization sessions always ended up feeling like work this is not what you want if it feels like work then your not doing it right you have to look forward to your visualization sessions and have fun with it if you re not looking forward to it and enjoying the process you won t be able to get your energy vibrations on the same level as your desire i agree that being in a quiet peaceful place while you re visualizing is the best way to go however everyone is different you need to do what ever is going to make your feel comfortable and keep your mind on track without wandering a quiet peaceful room might be exactly what you need so i do recommend you try it this way before anything else if you can stay focused on your visualizations in a quiet peaceful room without having your mind stray about then this will have a greater effect on the positive outcome that you desire as i mentioned though everyone is different quiet rooms don t work well for me so i use music i take baths every night and when i do i bring my phone with me so i can listen to pandora this works well for me i enjoy the music and therefore it helps me to enjoy my visualizing sessions all the more which helps keep me focused on what i am visualizing as well the music helps to keeps my happy vibrations i like to call it at very high level i have actually had some very coincidental experiences with the lyrics of songs that would come on and what i was visualizing i guess you could say i had some twilight zone moments as you are visualizing you must see things as if you are still seeing things from your own eyes this gives your visualizations the effect that it is actually happening to you at that moment you should not be watching things happen to you in your visualizations you must make it look as though it is happening at that very moment if something were really happening to you at that very moment you wouldn t be able to see it happening to you would you when you look at yourself without a mirror you can see your arms your chest your legs your feet you can see practically every part of your body except your face when you visualize you should only see these things as well lets use a couple examples to show you exactly what i mean lets say you get paychecks in the mail if you want to see a certain amount of money on those paychecks this is how you would visualize it first of all you have to walk to your mailbox to get your check start by visualizing your hand opening your front door and then take notice of the scenery outside your front door if you look down you can see your feet taking a few steps onto your porch as you step outside as you are walking to the mailbox you can see the mailbox getting closer now you are visualizing your mailbox right in front of you remember when you are visualizing all of this you cannot see your face you can only see parts of your body the mailbox and the scenery of your front yard now you are visualizing your hands reaching into the mailbox and pulling out all the mail you rummage through the mail finding your check mixed in with all the advertisements and junk mail then you visualize what you would see as you close your mailbox and walk back into your house now you have to open your check you see your hands holding the check you can see your name on the front of the envelope and whom it came from you then visualize your hands tearing at the seal and opening it up you pull the check out unfold it and then you visualize exactly what the check might look like along with your name and the amount you wish to see on it then you get excited about it before visualizing it is best to know exactly what something will feel and look like if you want to go on a trip somewhere look up on the internet what the weather is like temperature winds humidity etc if you want a certain car go take it for a test drive to get an idea of what the inside of the car might look and feel like if you want a certain house drive by it often and memorize what it looks like on the outside if it s on the market go to its open house even if you don t know what the inside of the house looks like but you know you still want it you can still visualize having it here is how you can see yourself not your face standing in front of the house with a key in your hand you see the house in front of you then you look down and see the key in your hand you look over and in the driveway of the home you see your car and a u haul trailer with your spouse and a few friends the u haul trailer is open and you see all your belongings in it ready to be moved into the house you look down at the key in your hand again and start heading for the front door you can see your feet taking the steps up the walkway the front door is getting closer now visualize your hand putting that key into the door and opening it when visualizing this way it could turn out that you only end up renting the home to prevent this imagine you and your spouse talking about how wonderful it is that you own that house visualize a full conversation about how you own it and how happy you are to finally have it visualize your hands signing the paperwork either to the house or the mortgage agreement from your bank now you aren t just renting that home you own that home if you want to see a certain amount of money in your bank account visualize going to the atm machine depositing a very large check and seeing the available balance on your printed receipt you can also visualize your hands typing in your bank account login info on the computer and then seeing your bank statement pop up know exactly what your bank account website looks like visualize the same thing every time don t switch up the things you visualize too much of course you can switch up the circumstances because you want more than just one thing i m sure however with each thing you want try to keep your visualizations the same every time you may find new things that you would like to add to a certain circumstance or wish but once you know exactly what you want stick with it changing it up will confuse the universe and therefore it won t know exactly what it is it s supposed to give you an example of this is if you have been visualizing a certain home you desire to have don t change the layout or color of that home during your visualization sessions you might do this when you are first starting out while you are still getting a feel for what you want it to look like but once you know exactly what you want it to look like try your best to visualize it exactly the same every time what the mind can conceive and believe it can achieve napoleon hill the way the universe works is it brings to us what it thinks we already have both your subconscious mind and the universe don t know whether you have something or not if the universe thinks that we have something that we actually don t then it works to make it so because the universe only gives us what it thinks we already have it is very important during your visualization sessions to feel as though you already have your desires as well if we want to get really technical about the loa it is not really our thoughts that we are sending into the universe it is actually our feelings that are being sent out the way this works is your feelings are basically brainwashing or tricking your subconscious mind into believing that you already have your desire have you ever heard the saying they lie so much that they believe their own lies this statement holds more truth to it than most of us realize people can and do trick themselves into believing false realities all the time and that s exactly what you need to do in order to transform your desires and wants into physical reality to visualize is to see what is not there what is not real a dream to visualize is in fact to make visual lies visual lies however have a way of coming true peter mcwilliams during your visualization sessions if you are not feeling totally and completely jubilated over what you are imagining that you have then it s not working you should literally be smiling you may even let out organic chuckles of excitement you need to force yourself to feel exactly how you would feel the moment these things actually do come to you in the physical world if you are doing it right what happens sometimes is that once you receive what you have been visualizing you realize that you were more excited during the visualizing than you were when it actually came into fruition this happens all the time not that it s not exciting when your dreams do become a reality it is but it is that extra excitement you felt during your visualizing sessions in the first place that helped you to acquire or achieve it feeling this excited is actually quite easy to do if you honestly believe in the law of attraction and if you honestly believe that you are going to get your wish this is also why i listen to music during my sessions it helps me to feel good and the music carries me to another place in my imagination where i actually do have all the things i want if you are not feeling the happiness that you should during your sessions try forcing a smile onto your face this works very well if you re not thinking of great things then forcing a smile can be very difficult to do on the other hand when you are thinking of great things a forced smile will usually turn into a genuine smile quickly and from there you will begin to feel happier and the happy feelings you are having become more believable if when you try these things you are still not feeling it then you need to do something that is going to lift your spirits when you visualize try adding people or pets that you love into the visualization this helps tremendously when i visualize the home i want to live in i visualize teaching my 2 year old daughter to swim in our new pool because we are going to have a pool it s a must have do not visualize people that you argue with or who have a habit of dragging you down this reminds me of something please allow me to sidetrack for just a moment you will find that when you are using the law of attraction and you are feeling good the loa will automatically cause situations that help to prevent you from associating with sad or angry people the law of attraction will automatically draw to you people that are on the same level of happiness that you are and it will also repel those who are on a lower frequency of happiness compared to your own this happens automatically most of the time however you may need to step in from time to time and moderate the people you see and engage with our emotions are extremely contagious if you are hanging around people who are unhappy don t be surprised when you find it difficult to stay happy yourself make sure that you do your best to engage with people who are going to keep you up instead of those who are going to bring you down remember that the vibration of your happiness is of the upmost importance in attaining the life you want okay now back to visualization there are a couple more things that i must make clear in order for your visualizations to work for you you must make sure that the things you are visualizing coincide with one another and that they do not contradict each another for example if you are visualizing the house you want to live in you better make sure that you can afford that house and all the bills that come with it if you are visualizing the type of lifestyle you want to have and are also visualizing your paychecks make sure the amount of your paycheck you are visualizing is enough money to pay for that lifestyle you are envisioning if you want a dog make sure it s the kind of dog you absolutely want before creating a mental video clip of it and sending it out into the universe although i love my dog i made this mistake i had never owned a dog before and now i have one i should have gone for a dog that was already grown and trained i should have researched the breed that i wanted first now i have to deal with it but like i said that s okay because i love my dog anyway always remember if you are not careful you could end up with things that you really don t want or you can end up with things you do want but can t afford or don t have the means to maintain again be careful of what you wish for i will be going over gratitude shortly but while we are still on the subject of visualizing i should mention this now as well make sure during your visualization sessions to thank who ever it is you believe in for the things you have right now and for those things you are visualizing having don t be thankful that you are going to receive these things be thankful as if you have already received them remember the universe only brings us the things that it believes we already have so be thankful as if you have already been blessed with these things you should have visualization sessions on a daily basis make a habit or routine of it you should take about 10 15 minutes a day to visualize each situation you visualize should only take about 5 minutes the rest of the time will be used to get into a relaxed state or to visualize multiple desires visualizing is necessary but you can do other things aside from visualizing that can help to achieve your goals if you have a dream it is always helpful to get as close to that dream as possible this means dressing and acting the part as mentioned actually getting into the house or vehicle you wish to attract is a great way to do this even though you have not attained the things you desire as of yet you should still find ways to associate yourself with those who have already attained the lifestyle that you dream of having yourself like your emotions success is contagious too really good actors have a habit of becoming the person who they are playing while making movies becoming the role they are assigned to play on a daily basis even when they are not working actually turns them into that person during the make of the movie the actors who do this play their characters better than those actors who don t do this real life works in the same way when you become the person you desire to be without having really achieved the necessary success yet it automatically sets your body in motion to make your wishes of becoming that person a reality this is not only the law of attraction but it also simple psychology if you paint in your mind a picture of bright and happy expectations you put yourself into a condition conducive to your goal norman vincent peale napoleon hill did an experiment actually i can t say it was an experiment because he already knew well of the psychology of clothes when he did it at one point napoleon hill went bankrupt he borrowed money from a friend but instead of investing the money in new projects that could have made him more money he went out and bought himself a whole new wardrobe of the most expensive designer clothes he could find he walked down the street in those clothes for several days with no money in his pockets napoleon hill felt like a million bucks one day as he walked he came across a man who stopped him the man was impressed by the way that napoleon hill was dressed which lead to a conversation about it the way that napoleon felt inside attracted to him this man for this man was very wealthy which although napoleon was broke he also felt himself to be a very wealthy man by doing this napoleon ended up with a great financial endeavor with this stranger and repaid his friend all the money he borrowed for his new wardrobe the person we feel ourselves to be is the person that we become if you want to be a millionaire associate yourself with millionaires if you want to be an author associate yourself with them join clubs buy nice clothes even you find them off the clearance rack go look at the car you want to buy and take it for a test drive if you want to get better at baseball find some people who are really good at it and associate yourself with them be creative before i decided to write a book i began sending myself fake checks in the mail i got that idea from the movie the secret it worked now i receive checks in the mail jim carrey did this too when he was first starting out he wrote himself a 10 000 000 check he dated it for 10 years later and wrote on it for acting services rendered jim carrey kept that check in his wallet for ten years until finally he earned his first legitimate 10 million dollar check when i would clean my house i would imagine that my nanny was doing it i would walk around the house and as i was cleaning i would actually pretend that my non existent nanny was doing it i would thank my invisible nanny by name and then thank the lord for bringing her to me i still couldn t afford the regular rate of a nanny and i knew this but i had a choice to make i had to either find some help with my kids or put my writing on the backburner until my two year old went to school full time about two months back i was in the middle of a book but couldn t get it done with both my young kids home all day i was beginning to feel very frustrated and helpless but then i stopped myself i said to myself no i am going to find some help i don t know how but i will make it happen then i picked up the computer and searched craigslist just to see what i could find i actually found someone wanting to work full time for 5 00 an hour these were her own advertised rates i called her met her and now i have a nanny do you know what the chances are of finding a nanny for 5 00 an hour in california uh like slim to none and what were the chances of me finding her before anyone else snatched her up even slimmer yet i found her i found her because i already believed and acted as though i already had her feel act visualize and believe that you already have what you want do this and soon you will have it feel act visualize and believe that you are already the person you want to be do this and soon you will become that person letting go as usual simply asking your higher power to bring you something and visualizing it isn t quite as simple as it sounds well actually it is that simple you see when you ask the universe for something and after every visualization session one very important thing to remember is to let it go afterwards this means you cannot dwell on how or when the answer will come to you you need to simply trust and have faith that it will come this will help the answers that you seek come to you faster and more clearly by letting it go it all gets done the world is won by those who let it go but when you try and try the world is beyond winning lao tzu chinese philosopher and founder of taoism when we have something we don t wonder when or how it will come to us because we already have it so when you dwell on those two things wondering how and when it is contradicting what you are trying to relay to your subconscious and to the universe it is telling them that what you want is something that you don t already have if your subconscious mind and the universe believe that you don t already have it it is going to continue working to keep it that way i know this sounds ridiculous and you re probably thinking let it go how the am i supposed to do that unless you have been training yourself on the law of attraction for years this is almost impossible to do what does a one year old do when you tell them not to touch something they touch it what are you going to do when you know you are not supposed to think about something you are going to think about it if you are going to think about it anyway why not turn something that is thought to be a no no into a positive thing that will actually help you in the end when you find yourself thinking about what you want try throwing in a very brief visualization about it as long as you are doing all the other things mentioned in this book related to the loa this shouldn t be too hard to do this in believable content when you find yourself wondering when and how something will come to you it is considered to be a negative moment but if you take those moments and throw in very brief positive visualizations about it only for about a minute or so you will be taking those moments that are usually thought to be no no s and making them useful to you with that being said you still want to make sure that you are fully aware of your feelings at all times if you feel that it is difficult to fully believe at the moment then don t add to that negative feeling by adding visuals to it first put on some music wait till you feel your spirits being lifted and then try it as i said usually when you are using the law of attraction on a daily basis you are already in the zone and can do this with positive feeling attached with no problems you can t visualize all day though you will still need to try and let go of any worry and wonder about the situation as much as you can keep yourself occupied do what ever you can to take your mind off of it read work watch good movies just keep busy if you are having a hard time with letting something go then just try to think as positively as you possibly can about it a positive thought is hundreds of times more powerful than a negative thought so if you think about it in a positive way most of the time then it will override any negative worries that you may sometimes have about the situation detach he who would be serene and pure needs but one thing detachment meister eckhart in order to get anything in life it is necessary to want it with passion but detaching yourself from it is just as important believe me when i say if you are attached to something that you want you won t get it likewise if you are attached to something you already have you will most likely lose it being attached to a want means that you want it so badly that you will not be happy without it being happy and content with what you already have means that you are thankful and appreciative with what you have you can want something with a passion without being so attached to it that the lack of it is disappointing being attached to something says to the universe that you are not happy and satisfied with what you have and that you will only be happy once you receive your desire being attached to something also says to the universe that you don t have what you want people are happy when they have what they want when you are attached to something that you don t have then you couldn t possibly be completely happy thus this tells the universe that you don t have it and the universe continues working to keep it that way want great things know that you will get them but also be completely content with all that you do have everything that you have now should be enough to make you completely satisfied with yourself and the life you are living feeling this way will ensure to always bring you more gratitude if you know anything about the law of attraction then you understand that one of the most important steps is to be thankful being thankful for what we have will always bring us more of those good things that s just the way life works with every given situation we all want to be good people if this is something that is not of importance to you i promise you when i say this having integrity and a good hearted soul will take you further in life and bring you so much more joy than if you don t own these qualities having gratitude for all that we have is only a small part of being a good person but it is certainly a must have quality for being a good person i could delve deeper into this subject of integrity but i really don t think it is necessary i will just hope that you understand the importance of having a kind hearted soul and that if this is an area you are lacking you work on becoming the person god wants and has created you to be so we know we should be thankful for what we have not only because it is morally right but also because it ensures us more of those good things but what about the things we don t have yet why should we be thankful for something we haven t even received yet that is a good question which deserves a good answer cultivate the habit of being grateful for every good thing that comes to you and to give thanks continuously and because all things have contributed to your advancement you should include all things in your gratitude ralph waldo emerson take a look at the last sentence of the above quote by emerson it says and because all things have contributed to your advancement you should include all things in your gratitude now i don t know if he actually meant to be grateful for everything we don t already have when he wrote or said this but if you think about it it makes sense he understood the law of attraction he understood that all things we don t have are still things just waiting for us to acquire either way you want to look at it take the quote how you see it to heart here are some more down to earth reasons that we should all be thankful for what we don t already have the reason we should be thankful for something we have not yet received is because the moment we have a thought of something we desire and have sent it out into the universe it has already begun to form it is in the beginning stages of becoming something tangible and it is already on its way to us if your parents sent you a check in the mail wouldn t you still thank your parents over the phone for sending it even before you received it you are the one who put the thought out into the world so even though you have not touched felt seen or experienced it yet it still already belongs to you no one else on this earth can add their emotions and thoughts to something that you have begun with your own thoughts your thoughts started it and it s only through your own thoughts that it can turn into reality therefore even if it s so small that a microscope couldn t even see it it s still yours for the taking let s say you want to own your own restaurant the very first time the thought of the restaurant crosses your mind the reality of it had begun forming right then and there at first it may be a really small and intangible little particle in space but even so you are the one who put it into motion and whether or not it is in it s full form or not it still belongs to you it s kind of like the stages of pregnancy at first the fetus is really small it needs time to grow into a baby you must nurture it feed it and love it until it is big enough to come out and be with you but even though it took 9 months was there ever a time you thought this wasn t your baby just because it hadn t been born yet absolutely not that baby was yours the moment you conceived it works the same with a desire that you put out into the universe it starts out small but as long as you feed it nurture it love it and help it to grow one day it will be ready it is up to you to use your positive thoughts emotions and love to help work your way up to the same frequency of your desire we ll go into this in more detail in a bit if someone buys you an expensive diamond watch but has put it on layaway do you thank them right then and there for thinking of you and putting that expensive watch on layaway or do you wait three months for the watch to come and then thank them but it hasn t even come to me and i m not even sure that it will you might say back to the check in the mail scenario if the check your parents sent got lost in the mail would you not thank your parents for sending you the money anyway i sure hope not it s not your parent s fault the check got lost in the mail they still sent the money they should still be thanked but why should i be thankful for something that is so small and hasn t even fully formed yet you might say back to the restaurant scenario say someone bought you a restaurant but it was a fixer upper would you not thank the person who bought if for you just because it wasn t a fully functional restaurant yet i should hope not being thankful ahead of time also helps us get what we want faster god see s that we are thankful if we are thankful for it then we must have already received it right and so again god or the universe makes it so saying thank you before we get something proves to him that we honestly do believe that we already have it therefore he believes that we already have it it proves our faith in him or in the universe or in what ever it is we believe in belief is i believe the biggest key to the law of attraction you can do every single step perfectly but if you don t honestly believe in it there is no possible way for the loa to work for you okay well there is one way even if you don t believe in the loa as long as you believe that what you want will happen then it will you must believe and what better way to show that you believe something is on it s way to you than to be truly thankful for it before you have received it as we express our gratitude we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words but to live by them john f kennedy there is something i would like to add here which is a little off course of being thankful but has everything to do with what happens to our thoughts i have been reading the book the law of success by napoleon hill this is a 16 lessons course on the most valuable ingredients of success in this book there is a section that talks about telepathy although there is no proof of this there is a theory that says that every single thought that we have is put out into the ether or space the thoughts that we don t work on turning into our reality stay there in the ether temporarily these thoughts stay there until someone else who s mind is on the same vibrating frequency of a thought itself picks up the thought as there own yes this seems very far fetched but as i said this book is meant for very open minded people this is the reason believed for telepathy and the reason that many people come up with the same or similar ideas as others we basically pick up on the thoughts of others that have been lost in space you have heard stories where people were accused of steeling ideas from others and turning it into something great yet the person accused is very adamant that they didn t steel it this makes me wonder if many of these cases had to do with this theory with this concept in mind even with the possibility of someone else picking it up know that your thoughts are always still your thoughts if a thought that you have doesn t come to fruition and someone else picks it up believing it to be their own your thought is still out there and the other person simply takes your thought that they have picked up and creates their own new thought with it by changing it up a bit so now there are two thoughts out there floating around in the ether both thoughts very similar to one another the original thought which came from you and the thought that someone else has created from picking up your original thought this is why it is very important to take your ideas and run with them make them happen by continually concentrating on them if you have a great idea and leave it in the ether without using it to fulfill your dreams don t be surprised when you see someone else living out that dream but remember your own original thought is still out there and so you too can still make something of it as well let us rise up and be thankful for if we didn t learn a lot today at least we learned a little and if we didn t learn a little at least we didn t got sick and if we got sick at least we didn t die so let us all be thankful buddha how does the law of attraction help us manifest the law of attraction sounds simple enough but how does it work imagine a piece of binder paper the lines on the paper represent the vibrating energy waves that you are on the wavelength your desire is on and all the lines in between represent how close or far your emotions have you from your destination on the top line you have your desire on the bottom line you have your thoughts and emotions which is where you are every bit of energy has a specific vibration frequency this vibration isn t visible to the eye but nonetheless it s there you yourself also have a vibrating frequency if you were to put yourself under a special microscope you would be able to see yourself actually vibrating your mood is what determines how high or low the frequency of your vibration when you re in a great mood the higher your vibration and vice verse now think of yourself as a magnet the rate of your own vibration will attract to you like a magnet the things that have the same vibration as yourself the higher your vibration the better things and circumstances you will attract into your life all the good and positive things in life will have a higher vibrating frequency your goal is to get your thoughts and emotions on the same vibrating frequency as your desire at the first moment you put your desire into motion you are still nowhere near getting what you want yes you have sent the thought out into the universe and so your desire has already begun to form into physical reality but you still have work to do before your desire comes to fruition when you are using the law of attraction in a positive way and using the rules and actions listed throughout this book you will reach your goal each positive feeling you have about what you want brings you farther up the binder paper and closer to what you want the more steady you hold your high vibrating frequency by feeling happy the faster this happens maybe the first couple days brings you a few lines up then the next week you are half way there if you continue on in this way on a daily basis it will eventually bring you up to the top line which is where your desire has been sitting patiently waiting for you and growing with every positive thought you have had this is when it actually shows up in your reality try and avoid roadblocks you will have your bad moments we all do but with each negative emotion you have it will take you longer to get to the top of that piece of binder paper it s like taking a long cross country road trip you have your destination in mind and your route is already planned out it s a straight shot from one side of the country to the other taking this easy route should get you there in no time unfortunately every time you lose sight of the law of attraction it s like hitting a detour sign you can still meet your destination but it will take you much longer now continually using the law of attraction all day and every day will help you avoid these unnecessary road blocks and help you get there quicker on the other hand if you put a positive thought of what you want out there but generally have negative emotions it could move you farther away from your desire in fact it will actually begin to bring you many more negative circumstances that you so wish to avoid even if your negative emotions do not pertain to the specific desire at hand the negative vibes you re sending out will still cause an interruption in your progress be aware of all of your emotions at all times whether they pertain to your desire or not many people try this new way of living by the law of attraction but they don t learn how to catch themselves in their negative emotions this causes them to hit so many roadblocks that it takes too long for them to reach their goal this is where people start to lose faith in it and then drop it all together i don t want this to happen to you learn to catch yourself in your negative thoughts turn these thoughts around as quickly as you can the moment you recognize them use anything you can to keep an upbeat happy and positive prospective on life living a life of zen simply enjoying every moment for what it is is the perfect way to help keep your vibrations on a high level read some books on the subject of zen it s not easy to just change your emotions overnight but through practice and training it can be done there are so many ways you can turn that frown upside down use music family friends hobbies funny movies pets or read a good book just do something anything to make yourself feel better and focused on the good stuff reading the signs every time we ask for something we are given an answer it could be that what we have asked for is directly brought to us it could be that the resources to acquire what we want is brought to us or it could simply be that an answer to a question is shown to us no matter what it is that we ask for we always receive some sort of answer it is up to us to recognize the answers we are given and use them to our benefit but how do we see the answers how do we know when an answer has been given and how do we understand what it is our higher power is trying to tell us simple we need to use our intuition our intuition is that gut feeling you get about something you know that feeling it s that feeling you get that tells you when something doesn t feel right like maybe it s not such a good idea it s also the feeling that tells you yes this just feels right like you just know you are on the right track this is the universe s way of talking to you this is it s way of telling you whether you are in line with achieving your goals and getting what you want and this is the universe s way of telling you which way to go when you have an idea that suddenly pops into your head it s your intuition and it s also god trying to tell you something i am a children s book author so i will use my writing as an example for you my first story that i wrote was about a horse named holly throughout the story holly meets many new animal friends there was a part in the story where i couldn t think of the right animal to use for holly to meet next i would specifically explain to god my situation god thank you for all that you have given me to write so far now i would like you to please tell me what animal to use in the next part of the story what animal should holly meet next once i was finished asking god for what i wanted i would immediately let it go and stop thinking about it i began cleaning my house because this is usually what i do to keep me occupied in order to keep my mind off of what it is i am wanting while i was cleaning i was picking up my daughters toys and came across a little rubber toy goat that was it i thought that was the animal i was supposed to use in my story i picked up many of my daughter s animal toys while i was cleaning that day how did i know it was the goat i was supposed to use in my story how did i know that this was an actual answer from god you need to learn to use your intuition god gives us answers to everything it s up to us to see the answers when he lays them before us we ve already gone over our conscious mind and our subconscious mind when god is trying to tell us something our conscious mind can try and talk us out of listening however our conscious mind is needed because it tells us of the possibilities that can go wrong in life we need these thoughts in order to be more aware and cautious in our actions we need our conscious mind for our own protection aside from that without our conscious minds we wouldn t be able to function it would be like we were brain dead we wouldn t have any thought at all without our conscious minds we wouldn t be able to feel emotions either we need to have thought in order to feel a certain emotion about that thought with the protection of our conscious mind come thoughts of logic in the beginning it can be difficult for one to know for sure that something is a message from the universe or god we might think we see something but our conscious mind will tell us no that s way too obvious or simple when we don t take seriously the little signs that we think we see and we allow our conscious mind to have the last word the answers that are shown to us could slip through our fingers when we receive some kind of message from our higher power we need to see beyond logic and find the real message that god is trying to send to us so how do we do that when we have so many different and sometimes conflicting thoughts going through our heads if you are not in total line with the universe then doing this is much harder but when we are putting the law of attraction into use in full force it is much easier to separate what our logical minds are thinking from the messages we are receiving from the universe when i saw my daughter s toy goat on the floor the first thing i thought was that s it the next animal i m going to use in my story is a goat now i could have questioned it and thought to myself but how do i know that s what god is really trying to tell me as i said i was in full force with the law of attraction and any other thought that might have been conflicting with the goat didn t come i just automatically knew that god or the universe was answering me and so i thanked god and went straight back to my story and began writing again if and when you have a conflicting thought always remember to go with your gut it s usually the first thing you think of or the first sign you think you see most of the time these signs come in the simplest form don t think about how and when the answer will come yet still pay close attention to your surroundings know for a fact that you have been heard and that you will receive an answer if you do these things then you will see your answer when it does come sometimes our answers aren t as noticeable as this example instead we might have a nagging feeling a thought that won t go away or a thought that keeps popping back up in our minds this is also our intuition or god speaking to us follow those thoughts listen to them and trust them trusting in your nagging thoughts is trusting in god and what he is telling you he will bring you every answer you require it is up to you to see it and trust it when you see it these signs can come to us in so many different ways we could see something in a magazine we could overhear someone else s conversation we could hear a song or see something in a book we might turn on a movie and someone in the movie might say something answering your question you could see a store or restaurant with a name that might give you an answer you could hear something on the radio or you could simply out of nowhere get a brilliant idea read the signs they are everywhere listen to your gut when you get an idea it s really not your idea at all it s your higher powers idea he s just giving it to you here are some very interesting examples on reading the signs i used the loa for every aspect of writing my book and getting the illustrations done once my book was finished i asked god how and where to find a publisher i had already sent my book out to several publishers with no answer so i waited patiently then one night an idea popped into my head while i was watching the movie the secret in the movie was jack canfield the author of the chicken soup for the soul books he talked about the story of how he used the law of attraction to get his career started and he mentioned his publisher but not by name i thought to myself jack canfield s publisher knew about him using the law of attraction if his publisher knew i was using the law of attraction maybe he would be willing to take a chance on my book now i know this must sound silly but remember with the law of attraction anything is possible anything i began searching the web for jack canfield s publisher all i kept finding was chicken soup for the soul publishing i sent them an email with no luck i needed an actual name i asked god for the name of jack canfield s publisher and he brought it to me one night i was scrolling my kindle in hopes of finding a good book on the law of attraction i came upon one of jack canfield s books and decided on that one in the very beginning of the book mr canfield mentions and thanks his publisher by name ha i have a name i wasn t even looking for it at the moment god just brought it to me when i least expected it the next part gets really weird i now needed an address again i went searching the internet it turns out that jack canfield s publisher breads horses what my story is about a little foal weird but it doesn t stop there this guy not only breeds horses but his horse ranch is in the same city that i used to live in and where my brother and his family still resides now this city is clear across the country what are the chances of that there were other authors on the movie i could have chosen to use why did i choose to search for jack canfield s publisher i chose him because god put the thought into my head god always knows the easiest and fastest way for us to achieve our goals he knew that my chances of being published by this publisher were higher than they would have been had i chosen anyone else in the end i did choose the indie route but with all of these crazy wild coincidences who knows what might have happened had i continued visualizing meeting jack canfield and his publisher but i have moved on since then and i am totally happy with the road i have taken everything that i wanted or needed just began coming straight to me with very little to no effort on my part if you end up watching the movie the secret you will notice the very well dressed man in it his name is bob proctor this man has such an extraordinary aura to him he was very fascinating to me i kept thinking to myself wow i love this guy i d really love to meet him i want hear more of what he has to say the next thing i knew i got an email it was an invitation to come and join the bob proctor streaming club it is an affiliate marketing club that allows you to watch weekly live streaming of bob proctor talking about the law of attraction and how to become successful by using it i wasn t searching for bob proctor online all i did was like him and think how awesome it would be to hear more of what he had to say and the answer of how to do that just came knocking on my door yes when we use the loa we do receive the answers we are looking for but what s really interesting is that everything we think about also gets returned to us in some shape or form when i began using the law of attraction i became a bit obsessed with it this is where some very uncanny twilight zonish things began happening again i m going to use examples of things that happened when i was publishing my first book it was during this time that i learned of the loa and i used it very intently on my book and publishing so these examples are the most clear in my mind to share with you to give you a better understanding of why the incidences i am about to share with you are so uncanny let me give you a quick rundown of my story my story is about a horse that is in search for the greenest most delectable grass it has a theme of you ll find it in your own back yard there s no place like home or the grass is always greener on the other side in the story holly hears a rumor that the grass is greener on the other side she gets so excited about this that she sets out on a journey to find it holly runs through a field climbs over a mountain and then makes her way through a forest searching for this delectable treat there is a part in the book where it says but she still hadn t found her greenest most delectable grass while i was writing my story and the whole time i was trying to figure out what to do with it once it was completed i kept hearing one particular song on the radio i heard this song every day sometimes twice a day it s that song from u2 i still haven t found what i m looking for if you re not familiar with the song let me tell you what it says i will run over mountains through the fields only to be with you but i still haven t found what i m looking for now that s weird this song isn t even the kind of music that comes on my radio station don t get me wrong i like u2 but it doesn t usually come on my radio stations yet for months i was hearing this song everywhere one time when i was in my car i turned on the radio but it was a different song playing the music just reminded me of the coincidence of that one particular song playing constantly over the past several months i began to laugh to myself about it i thought it was very amusing well it got even more amusing because it just so happened that the very next song that came on the radio after my little laugh about it was u2 i still haven t found what i m looking for coincidence i think not i now know for a fact that there is no such thing as a coincidence i kept hearing that song because i had such intense focus on my story i was using the law of attraction with such intensity that everything i thought about was coming back to me in some way or another before i had simplified my book for small children there was a part in the rough draft of my story where it said this the sunsets back home are beautiful all the colors of the land bounce off the earth and explode into the sky like fireworks the very night i wrote that i went out into my back yard a phone rang and i heard the man who lived behind us answer it keep in mind that i usually don t ever hear this man speak but for some reason on this day he was clear as a bell my neighbor answered the phone and said hey how was the sunset did you see a lot of colors i have had way too many coincidences to ever again believe in coincidences i was pretty much done writing this chapter you are reading right now but i had to come back to it tonight i was reading my daughter a bedtime story at the moment we are reading the diary of a wimpy kid which my daughter picked out we have never read this book before while reading tonight we came across a page where the main character talks about a stuffed elephant named ellie i thought this was very interesting right now i just so happen to be working on the illustrations of my next children s book which has an elephant in it an elephant named ellie i thought i was being clever with that when i wrote my story it turns out the author of the diary of a wimpy kid was just as clever i just wanted to share that little tidbit to give you another example of the kinds of things you should expect to see very often once you start using the law of attraction one more interesting example on this and then we move on one day my family and i wanted to take a day trip to a river that wasn t too far from our home we didn t know where it was so we called a friend and asked for directions on the way there we were all talking about names that we loved my 14 year old daughter had recently seen the movie children of the corn so she told us how much she loved the name malachi but she didn t just say that she loved the name she is 14 so everything she says is very dramatic she doesn t just like the name malachi she loves the name malachi with passion he was the creepy one in the movie the leader of all the kids well we ended up getting lost on that trip and ended up at a different part of the river than we had originally intended after about an hour of driving out of our way we finally found a spot unloaded and began our day at the river we were having a great time just the family and i when a man and his son floated up by boat to our little spot they got out of their boat and ended up having a little picnic right next to us we got to talking and as it turned out the boys name was malachi the universe was working in full swing that day we didn t have to get lost and we didn t have to choose that exact location at that exact time god brought us to that location because the law of attraction was working in order to lead us or lead our thoughts right back to us this wouldn t be uncanny if malachi was even a halfway common name here in the states but it s not in fact the father told us that he named his son after the movie children of the corn we weren t talking about names at the river and this guy had no clue of our conversation in the car before we got there believe it or not god knows it s true too weird for coincidence take action action is the foundational key to all success pablo picasso this last step is where most people fall off the tracks when using the law of attraction and because they do not complete this last step many people unfortunately throw it all out the window by thinking that the loa just doesn t work many people think that when they use the law of attraction what they want is supposed to simply come to them this is the case sometimes but most of the time it will take some kind of action on your part hey this isn t a get rich while you sit on your butt scheme even with the law of attraction you will still have to work for what you achieve in life that is why it s called achieving your goals high achievers spot rich opportunities swiftly make a big decision quickly and move into action immediately follow these principles and you can make your dreams come true robert h schuller with this last quote it has brought to my attention some truth that i had discovered not too long ago this words swiftly and quickly are used in this quote this is truer than meets the eye successful people own this rare quality and it is a must have quality for you to create your own success i am going now into the subject of action but taking action isn t just taking action it is taking action quickly you might want to overlook this very small seemingly unimportant bit of information however i stress to you not to do so i used to be the kind of person who could sit in a restaurant and look at the menu for a half hour if i was allowed i refuse to ever do that ever again i have learned that becoming a successful person is also becoming one who can make a decision as swiftly as the question has been asked i won t get into the psychology of it other than to say this time used on making decisions means that you are person who doesn t know what they want obviously knowing what you want is detrimental to making it happen also the time taken on making decisions means less time spent on putting the decision into action no further explanation should be needed on this last sentence after you have asked believed and visualized you must take action right away once you get a flash of intuition on your next step toward your goal any delay in this could result in that action not being available for later use the quicker you take action on what your higher power is trying to tell you the quicker you will get to your goal defer no time delays have dangerous ends william shakespeare this doesn t mean that you need to learn to make quick business decisions the moment you read this especially if it doesn t come naturally to you start out with your small every day decision making practice making quicker decisions and get better with it in time you will discover that this practice will begin to convert itself into your larger decisions and then also onto your business decisions achieving goals is work but when it is something that you have a passion for this work becomes your playground many millionaires don t seem as though they work very hard and many of them don t this doesn t mean that they don t do much to acquire their wealth in fact if we did what they did it might feel like a lot of work to us probably even too much work that is because what they love to do and what we love to do differs these people have found what they love to do and they take action on what they love to do all day every day that s why so many of these successful people don t seem to be struggling just to get their work done because they aren t struggling they are literally enjoying themselves as they are doing it they have been doing it with such enthusiasm passion and perseverance that what they do comes easily and naturally to them you need to find your passion it needs to be something that you too will want to take action on all day every day that which we persist in doing becomes easier not that the task itself has become easier but that our ability to perform it has improved ralph waldo emerson so many people look at the wealth of others and wish they could walk in their shoes even if just for a day yet most times we don t take the time to consider the work and action that it took for these people of wealth to walk in their own designer shoes one of the most important things for us all to remember is to never envy someone else s wealth but instead we should strive to acquire the desire and the determination to do what ever it takes to acquire our own wealth in our own way we should all take action on our own life we are given million dollar ideas on a daily basis and what s more we are also given the means to transform those million dollar ideas into our own reality it s so unfortunate that so many of us have fear lack of drive or lack of desire to do the things it takes for us to live the same luxuries that we so often envy in others when you get a million dollar idea don t delay if you don t know how to get the ball rolling stop and ask your higher power for your first step once you have received your answer and have been given a glimpse into your next action don t delay do it now time delay you may not get all the answers you seek right away you may ask the lord for something and do everything right yet you are still waiting for your answer you want to take action and you want to do it now that s perfect but you are still waiting for god to lead you in the right direction on what to do don t fret in life there is always a time delay for everything once i finished my first children s story i sent it to the editor i had never met this editor and she was trying to convince me that i shouldn t try to publish it into a book because of how difficult and unlikely it is to do instead she was recommending that i send it out to magazines and writing contests although i appreciated her advice because i know that it really did come from her heart i had already made up my mind i wanted my book to be published and there was no way to talk me out of it i had sent my book to several publishing companies without a word back from them my husband kept mentioning self publishing but oh the stigma self publishing was for people who couldn t get their books published not for me not for my book finally one day my husband mentioned it again at this point i still hadn t looked into self publishing at all this time just to get him off my back i told him i would look into it i searched the web and found out exactly how easy self publishing my book would be i was definitely interested now but i was still unsure when i asked god for guidance i happened to come across a book on my kindle about self publishing i wasn t looking for books about self publishing i didn t even know people were writing books about this the book just happened to show up in the advertising area of my kindle so i picked it up and read i liked what i saw and so i began deliberately searching for more books about the subject as usual god brought me my answer obviously i ultimately decided to go with self publishing on amazon and with all that i have learned i am so happy that i did to this day even if someone did want to publish my book i m not sure i if i would actually take them up on their offer or not even if jack canfield s publisher called i wouldn t know what to say had it not been for the time delay associated with the law of attraction i may have never have had this opportunity i could have ended up with regret everything that we want and visualize takes time to show up in our reality there is a very good reason for this this goes back to earlier i have already mentioned a couple times to be careful about what you wish for you must still be careful but this time delay helps us so that we have more time to think about what we really want and whether it is right for us the time delay helps prevent us from finding ourselves in a bind by giving us the opportunity to change our minds if needed many times what we want isn t necessarily what is best for us or maybe you might want to change your mind over something simple like if something better were to come along the time delay is our safeguard the universe knows the best ways for you to get what you want you may have something that you want in mind and you may also have in mind a way for you to get it however god may know of a better way for you to get it or he may even have something better in mind for you this is where the law of allowing comes in as long as you are sending out a high frequency vibration you must trust that you will only be attracting great things into your life even if the universe doesn t bring you exactly what you want trust that the universe only wants the absolute best for you continue on with your good moods bringing about your high frequency vibration and allow the universe to bring into your life even better things than that of which you originally wished for a great thing to do when asking your higher power for something is to ask for it and add the words something more or something better to it for instance you could say lord please help me find a way to get 50 or more sales a day or you could say i would like my books rank to be 3 000 or better this will help to ensure you get what you want or something even better have patience unless you change your mind keep the vision of what you want in your heart and continuously know that what you have asked for or something better has already been set in motion great things are already on their way to you there is no set time for how long something will take to manifest into your life that all depends on you it depends on how often you have your visualizing sessions and how strong your emotions are when you perform them it depends on how you feel and the vibes you are sending out into the universe throughout the rest of the hours in your days you are the only one who decides how long something will take acquiring a million dollars could take the same amount of time as acquiring that new pair of jeans you have been wanting if you believe that a large amount of money should take longer than a pair of jeans then it will setting goals man is a goal seeking animal his life only has meaning if he is reaching out and striving for his goals aristotle how can we accomplish goals if we haven t set any goals to achieve we can t we need to set goals to have something to aim for in our lives without them we can only go so far why settle for mediocre with set goals we can reach for the stars there is no such thing as aiming too high it is possible to acquire a million dollars over night but lets be real for a moment it s also very unlikely that it will happen to you it s not unlikely that you will acquire the million dollars but it is unlikely that you will acquire it overnight from the moment you wish for it with all this talk about thinking positive and everything is possible why on earth am i going back on it now i m not going back on it everything that i have told you is absolutely true unfortunately our subconscious minds are not so easily persuaded of this fact we might know that anything is possible but that doesn t mean that in our hearts we believe that it will happen to us there is a way to get around this dilemma you need to create two lists you need to actually sit down and write them out on the first list you are going to write down all of the things that you wish to acquire in your life this might take a while because you should have on it everything you want in all areas of your life your career finances where you want to live what kind of house you want to live in your vehicles education your relationships children anything and everything you can think of should be on that list when creating goals they should not be easily attained if something is easy to accomplish then it s not really accomplishing much is it your goals should seem as though they are almost impossible to achieve achieving small goals that are very easily accomplished is putting limitations on what you are capable of in reality there are no limitations on what you are capable of so dream big your dream should be just out of reach but not out of site denis waitley and remi witt you need to make sure that this list is very specific and detailed as well what color make and model car do you want what do you want your house to look like from size to the color of paint on the walls how much money do you want in your bank account savings account and investments how much will your annual income be again anything and everything you can think of should be on that list remember you can never aim too high the higher goal a person pursues the quicker his ability develops and the more beneficial he will become to the society i believe for sure that this is also a truth maksim gorky on your second list you are going to write down your short term goals what is your life going to look like five years from now you may even want to have a third list with even shorter term goals the reason for the second and third lists is because as said above your subconscious mind may have a harder time believing that you will receive the larger things that are on your first list your subconscious mind needs to believe wholeheartedly what it is that you are trying to send out into the universe otherwise it just doesn t work when you breakdown your goals into smaller ones and work on achieving them in smaller steps it makes it easier for your subconscious to believe that they will come true smaller steps may not always necessary some people can believe that that their larger goals will manifest into reality and don t need to break them down if you don t want to break it down into smaller steps with smaller and more believable goals make sure you pay close attention to the way that you are feeling about your goals during the day and how strong your positive emotions are during your visualization sessions you may even want to experiment first try some visualization sessions by using your long term goals in them then try the same thing using your shorter term goals that have been broken down see how believable each of these set of goals are while you are visualizing them you always want to go with the goals in which you have the strongest positive emotions for when visualizing you ll want to place your list somewhere you will see it everyday just walking by it is not going to be of much help to you you need to read it everyday or even several times a day most people read their list of goals at night right before they go to bed leaving it on a nightstand next to your bed is a good idea i leave mine on the refrigerator that way i see it several times during the day i only read it once or twice a day but having it on the fridge helps to remind me of my goals several times a day you can start out small if need be but do not sell yourself short make sure you have a list of large long term goals as well everyone can achieve all they that they want the biggest problem is when people don t believe that they have it within themselves to accomplish greatness and therefore aim too low some have no aim at all too many people live their lives with no direction no direction leads to little success have direction know what you want and keep the mentality that you are not only capable of achieving it but that you are going to achieve it you can make a name for yourself and the higher you aim the bigger your legend will be thousands of geniuses live and die undiscovered either by themselves or by others mark twain there is nothing different between the steve jobs the thomas edisons and the oprah winfreys of the world and you in fact most of the greatest people in our history came from poverty and were uneducated you do not need to be educated to become something great educate yourself in what you love there is greatness within you find it and then set out to share it with the world make your own greatness happen anybody can do just about anything with himself that he really wants to and makes up his mind to do we are all capable of greater things than we realize norman vincent peale your relationships once you begin using the law of attraction toward your relationships you will be amazed at what happens if there is something about a certain someone that bothers you you can turn that around it s not that using the loa will completely change a person that is highly unlikely however using these simple steps will either change the way that person is toward you personally or the law of attraction will work in order to make the things they do not bother you so much when you are not getting along with someone or they are treating you poorly forcing yourself to think positively about them will definitely help to turn things around maybe there is someone whom you yourself don t care for much yet there is no avoiding this person sometimes we think poorly of those whom which we would benefit the most by getting along with them using the loa for this even if you are the person doing the poor treatment onto another could benefit you greatly it could help with your love life your marriage relationships you re your boss or co workers and friends no matter whom it is we re talking about there s always at least one positive thing about everyone your first step is to find those positive qualities in that person what ever it may be find it it could be the simplest of things it could be the fact that you admire their success not envy their success but admire their success it could be that you like the way someone parents her child it could be that you like the way someone dresses or something as simple as liking the way they wear their hair these positive qualities that you find about the person don t even have to have anything at all to do with yourself even if this person is only nice to one person in the world it is still a positive quality sit down and write down every single thing you do like about that person don t make things up you only have to write down one thing if that s all you can think of you really won t have to make things up anyway even if it is only one simple good thing that you find about a person once you begin to focus on it constantly and intently you will begin to not only see more of that one good quality in the person but you will begin to see other positive qualities as well now i m not saying that if you focus on one good quality that person will become mother theresa over night but over time as you begin to notice more of the good qualities you will more good qualities to focus on it s a natural part of nature from there it works like a domino effect the more good qualities you notice and focus on in a person the more other good qualities you subconsciously begin to see don t forget to be thankful for that person s good qualities if you forget this crucial step of gratitude you may see a little bit of change in how you feel toward that person or how they are treating you but it will only be to a certain extent being grateful will always take what you are given onto the next level if you have conversations with others about this person try not to participate in any negative talk about them even when that person isn t around you should still focus on how happy you are about their positive qualities throughout the day once you stop doing this don t be surprised if your relationship with this person goes back to the way it was before you can use the law of attraction to better your relationship with people but remember you have to continue using the loa in a positive way in order to keep those good relationships on a positive level you can use this idea anyone no matter what their ages are i did this with my teenage daughter she was very difficult to deal with all she wanted to do was fight or so i thought but when i found the law of attraction and began using it regularly i realized that she wanted to fight because i was constantly telling other people that she wanted to fight of course everything i was telling other people about my daughter was coming right back to me my relationship with her was very difficult for a long time and it made it even more difficult to talk positively to other people about her it was only when i began ignoring the behaviors of my daughter that i didn t like and began focusing on every good quality she had that our relationship began turning around now this isn t to say my daughter is a different person i cannot change who she is but i have found a way to make my own relationship with her better if you are single you also can use the loa to find the love of your life in a letter to the universe or god mention how grateful you are for the loves that you ve had in your life then write down all the qualities you wish to see in your future lover put the date that you wish to meet this person by and put it on your nightstand read it every morning and night and know for a fact that your soul mate will come keep the faith the more faith you have that he she will come and the more often you read that list of qualities the sooner you are bound to cross paths with them remember even when we put the date that we wish to acquire something it doesn t always happen on or by that day as said it all depends on how much positive emotion and faith you put into something that determines when it will manifest just keep reading the letter and it will happen one of the most important things we have to remember is that our thoughts and feelings give off particular vibes others can feel whatever vibe you are sending out if you are going about your life thinking things like why don t i have anyone i feel so lonely i just wish i could find someone perfect for me when you are feeling this way you are giving off that negative vibe to not only the universe but also to the people around you when people are happy and content with what they have it gives them a brighter aura and makes people want to be around them more it makes them much more approachable when you feel negativity about the love that you are missing it ends up repelling the love that you are looking for health before i begin this chapter i first want to make it clear that i am in no way condoning or suggesting avoiding medical doctors if you have a serious medical condition however you should also know that the law of attraction could cure any kind of mental or physical ailment as well as i stated at the beginning of this book no we can t simply grow back missing limbs instead if you are using the law of attraction you wouldn t grow back an arm but you might receive an email from a doctor wanting to create a prosthetic for you possibly even at no cost to you with this beautiful blessing our higher power has given us we have the power to cure any physical and mental sickness we can cure phobias and weight problems we can cure any kind of disorder you have if you are someone who was born with a syndrome or disease you may not be able to cure it completely but you will be able to live a normal and better more fulfilled life by using the loa even with these issues i have mentioned in many of the previous chapters the concept of writing lists these lists will be more useful to you than you realize first of all when we list things we are listing every little thing that we want as specifically as possible when we look at and read these lists it helps us to remember these specific things that we want in perfect detail as we wrote it sure without the list we still have a vague idea of what we want but vague isn t good enough for the universe to understand exactly what it is we want using a list and reading it on a daily basis helps to embed these dreams of ours into our subconscious minds into our memory which is the key to getting what we want when we have exactly what we want completely memorized it ensures that we are able to ask for the exact same thing every time we visualize if the specifics of what we are asking for is a little bit different than what we asked for the last time this leads to confusion as to what the universe thinks you want if the universe is confused as to what you want and what it believes you already have or don t have then it is impossible for your higher power to give it to you so really this list is more for your own sake you are using it to memorize it so mot to confuse your higher power of what it is you want when you write your list of what you want to achieve in life your wishes of health must go on that list if you have a sickness or ailment that you are tying to fix or change then write this down on your list of goals if you end up with an ailment after you have already written your list then update the list your wishes of health can be as simple or as complicated as you wish do you want clearer skin do you want to lose weight do you want to level out your blood sugar do you want to quit smoking write them all down if you have discovered that you have larger ailments that require medical attention than while you are seeking that attention write those things on your list too are you in therapy learning to walk again do you have cancer have you been stricken down with pneumonia do you have severe asthma many of the more serious aliments are always a possibility to cure as well even aids has been documented being cured by using the loa however don t forget the discussion about how your subconscious mind must wholeheartedly believe that you what you are asking for will occur in your life unfortunately this is much harder to do with your more serious illnesses so experiment with what your mind is capable of while at the same time seeking out the medical attention you need if you are sick read your wish of goals daily even several times a day continuously tell your higher power how happy and thankful for the health that you di have and then be thankful that your major ailments are already on their way to being healed you must live as though you have never even had the ailment to begin with medical attention combined with the use of your mentally positive attitude will bring more health and success to you than seeking medical attention alone use comedy friends and fun times to keep your spirits up as often as you can you need to smile and laugh as much as you can do what ever you need to do in order to keep your spirits up and your own vibrating frequency on the same frequency as the health you aiming to acquire don t think the words disease or the name or symptoms of your ailment at all focus on only health in other words don t write down on your list i don t want to have breast cancer anymore doing that is completely focusing on the fact that you have breast cancer which is defeating your purpose write on your list i am so happy that my breasts are healthy again only focus on the health aspect of it not your sickness mediating is good to use to help heal your body find a quiet place and spend a few minutes a day doing this exercise close your eyes and relax then start from the top of your head imagine a glowing or light of white or glitter or any mystical design that you find a sign of positive energy and health white is usually the best as this color is a sign of health imagine this swirl around your head and pulling out any negativity imagine this white swirl literally pulling out anything toxic to the body this includes sickness disease and unpleasant thoughts then imagine the swirl surrounding your neck shoulders and arms pulling more toxic energy from your body then the swirl will continue around your chest and abdominal area then imagine it around your hips private areas legs and feet once you have finished this process you can take it one step further if you d like and imagine this purity swirling through the insides of your body feel it go around all your vital organs muscles and tendons etc you can even imagine this magical swirl running through your bloodstream and veins visually imagine this white swirl collecting all the toxins illnesses and negative energy as it sails through your body then watch it as it bursts sending every negative thought illness ailment pain disease or impurity out and as far away from your body as possible watch the negative energy dissipate as it goes before i end this chapter i would like to share with you an example of how being thankful for my health and keeping my mind only on my health has worked for me believe this story or not it happened before i knew about the law of attraction i had a very small lump on one of my breasts i never went to the doctor for it maybe out of fear or peer negligence but either way i didn t go because i didn t go to the doctor i don t know if this lump was malignant or benign but it was there for a long time and it was growing it was growing although very slowly every night in the bath i would look at it and feel it to see if it was bigger than the night before this went on for about two years thankfully it never got bigger than a coffee bean after learning about the law of attraction like i said i went into it full gear with it in my medicine cabinet i placed a note where i could see it every morning the note said my health is keeping me alive thank you for my health this is something i got from one of rhonda byrne s books at any rate i read that note every morning and then repeated it over and over for several minutes each time i saw it i would also read the note several more times throughout the day as i used the restroom i would actually feel great too as i would repeat the phrase my health is keeping me alive thank you for my health in addition i also used the exercise above several times a week for about 3 weeks i never checked the lump on my breast i don t know why i didn t check it i believe it was because i was so focused on the other aspects of my life that the loa was helping me to achieve that i just didn t think about the lump then one night while i was taking my bath i decided to check it the lump was gone gone gone gone after 2 years of worrying that i could have cancer it was finally gone there is a similar story in the movie the secret i cannot prove to you that my story is the truth and not stolen from the movie but i know it and god knows it to be true so as i write this with tears in my eyes i would like to thank you my lord once again thank you for my health for my health is keeping me alive thank you so very much feeling positive and happy prevents disease and sickness when you get sick it isn t only because you have caught it from someone but it also because your emotions were not healthy disease and sickness cannot live in an emotionally healthy body it is absolutely possible to cure yourself by having a positive outlook on life however it is much easier to prevent sickness in the first place by having a positive attitude than it is to cure it keeping yourself emotionally happy thankful for every little thing you have thankful for your talents thankful for the air and the life that you have been given will help to ensure that you live a fully and abundantly in all areas of your life money health love friends and power can all be yours qualities you wish to attain in your character are there qualities that you wish to attain in your own character do you wish to be more organized do you wish you had clearer skin do you wish you had more confidence do you wish you had more patience if so know that you can attain all of those qualities in your character and more as the same with everything else write a list of those qualities you wish to have and read the list daily believe that you can have those qualities then believe that you will have them simple right but there a couple more things you can do i have heard of others doing this next experiment and i recently began doing it myself in fact i read this in the book the law of success by napoleon hill he stated that when a friend of his used this concept his friend naturally began to attain all the qualities he desired for himself he actually became a cross between many different people so much so that others around him noticed as well the experiment think of those people who already possess the qualities you wish for yourself at night while you re in bed before you go to sleep play a little clip in your mind imagine yourself sitting around a table with each of these people go around the table having a short conversation with each of them telling them that you wish to attain that one specific quality they possess then imagine each of them happily giving you their quality you can imagine them actually handing the quality to you you can imagine their quality magically flowing from them to you it doesn t really matter how you do this just use your own imagination this sounds silly i know but it does work in time the more you do this the more of these qualities you will begin to see in yourself as other will notice it too napoleons friend used celebrities in his experiment but you can also look for these qualities in other people that you meet on a daily basis admire these qualities in them don t just admire from afar but make sure you tell the person that you admire this certain quality in them tell someone how nice she looks tell someone that they were very kind in a gesture they had just done tell someone that they give off a pleasing aura don t make things up be honest and when you see something you honestly admire tell them this will do two things the law of attraction will work to add those qualities to your own character plus it will not only make the other persons day a whole lot better but it will also lift your own spirits for the day it s a natural reaction for us to feel good when we make others feel good and that s what this whole book is about doing what ever we can to feel good and in turn create our own success you should try and do this at least once a day the more often you do it the more natural it will become for you additionally the more often you do this the quicker these great qualities you have been admiring in others will become a part of your own characteristics as you do these things on a daily basis don t forget to keep reading that list when you first begin this process you will find everything and anything in others that you find appealing they might not necessarily be the items on your list the more often you read that list of the qualities you really want for yourself the more often you will begin to see those exact qualities in others then by admiring them in due time those qualities will become a part of your own characteristic as well money is already a part of you this is a concept that is difficult for some people to grasp everything in this universe is made up of energy because all the energy is connected everything is one and a part of one another as one single being there are no gaps what so ever in this big ball of energy so what does that mean for us if everything is energy including us including the trees outside including the planets and even everything outside our own solar system then we are those things your dog is energy the smoke coming from your bbq when you grill is energy yes we are all a part of all those things too but we aren t only a part of those things we are those things there is no you there is no me again we are all one being each one of us and each and every thing this universe holds is simply a very tiny part of this one huge being look to your left what do you see right now i see an end table that end table is vibrating energy it is part of this universal energy connection although the table is too far from me to reach out and touch it the table is still completely connected to me this is because there is an unimaginable amount of energy between the table and i acting like a chain link connecting me to the table this chain link of energy connects us to everything if you are living in the united states you are actually connected to every single person and thing in china by this chain link of energy i know you got to this section of the book in hopes of learning how to get more money now you might be asking okay but what does all of this have to do with money come on already but really it has everything to do with money and don t worry i m getting to it very shortly because we are a part of everything and everything is a part of us we need to start thinking of the things that we want as already being a part of us too do you have a talent that you feel is such a part of you that if it was taken away you wouldn t feel whole anymore that s because it is a part of you it is a part of your identity this is how rich people feel about money money is a part of their identity this is how you need to feel about money and everything else you wish to attain you need to feel this way because even if you have only 5 to your name money really is a part of your identity too just the same as it is for a millionaire i know this sounds crazy but if everything is connected and there isn t one thing that is separated from this one big universal ball of energy then we really have no personal identity our identity is a mixture of everything else in this universe think of yourself as if money is connected to you as though you are one with it because in reality you are most people think of money as a separate part of themselves they think of it as something they need to seek out but once you begin feeling as if you are connected to it just as you are connected to every other bit of energy in this universe you will begin to notice that you don t have to seek it if and when you begin to feel that money is already a part of who you are you will find that money will begin to flow into your life naturally wealthy people feel this way about money they feel that it s already a part of their identity it really is s a part of everyone s identity but it is the rich people who know this or at least feel it they might not know what this feeling is exactly but they still feel it money should be thought of as easily attainable and that there is plenty of it not only for others but for you as well you are probably thinking we are talking about rich people of course they feel this way money is easily attainable for them but what we forget is that most rich people weren t always rich there are many millionaires who have inherited money or businesses sure but most millionaires are self made they kept the frame of mind that money is easy to get for as long as they can remember the universe then made money easily attainable for them when they were broke even after they became rich they didn t worry about how or where their next moneys would come they just knew it would come because they had the understanding that money was already a part of them and was meant to be theirs once you feel this way yourself money will also become just as attainable for you as well this is how we should feel about everything we want in life remember everything is energy and all energy is connected no gaps in the connection everything is a part of everything i have talked about writing lists and visualizing these are actually not completely necessary if you are in total line with the universe if you are in a constant state of appreciation for everything you have and every wonderful thing you are going to be given you will receive what you want without the lists and visualizations when you are appreciative of everything the universe believes that you already have everything and therefore brings to you more joy and fulfillment than you can imagine lists and visualizing are only tools that help as reminders for you to keep your focus on what you want they are reminders to constantly keep your feelings and emotions in check and reading and visualizing the things you want helps you to feel happy all kids excited around their birthday or christmas time because they know they are going to receive good things they think about it for weeks sometimes even months in advance thinking about it keeps them happy practically the whole month of december this works in the same way for you thinking about the things you want keeps and knowing that you are going to receive them or even something better keeps you happy as we discussed over and over again your mood is what determines what it is that you are going to attract into your life with this said write down how much money you want to receive on your list of goals visualize it too use these two things as extra tools to help keep your emotional state and vibrating frequency at an all time high the higher you feel about life the more you will get out of life have confidence you may fail many times before you succeed everyone who has ever achieved anything in life knew they were going to do it if you look back on your life right now you will notice that with everything that you have ever accomplished you had an emotional drive to accomplish it you had kept the frame of mind that you were going to achieve that goal no matter what it took you also had complete faith that you were going to do it do you know what happens to those who do not have the confidence that they are going to achieve a goal they give up it s inevitable people fail all the time but achievers sometimes have to fail and fail and fail again before succeeding babe ruth the greatest known baseball player in history had the record for the most homeruns during his time but he also had the record for the most strikeouts during his time thomas edison had 1000 failed attempts at the light bulb before he finally got it right henry ford went bankrupt five times before he succeeded albert einstein didn t speak until he was four and didn t read until he was seven not reading till the age of seven in this day and age isn t so abnormal but einstein s teachers described him as mentally slow yet look at what he has accomplished in his life in high school robin williams was voted least likely to succeed that doesn t seem to be the case now does it what did all these people have in common the stacks were against each and every one of these people yet not one of them thought for a moment that they would fail as others thought each and every one of these people despite what others thought had the confidence within themselves that they would make their dreams come true and they did that is exactly how you need to feel about you re your goals and all of your endeavors it s an unfortunate thing that not everyone automatically has this kind of self confidence naturally luckily there are ways to get around this wall you are going to need to brainwash yourself just the same as we talked about brainwashing our subconscious minds believing in the law of attraction is a wonderful thing there is so much that you can do with it for many believing isn t an issue but instead it s continuously keeping their emotions at a high and happy frequency that is the issue we all have our bad moments even people who have been studying and using the law of attraction for years have negative thoughts we can t prevent them completely and as said before we really don t want to for they come from our conscious mind which is something we need for our own protection what we can do though is moderate these negative thoughts and through doing this we will train our emotions until one day the happiness that we feel will come to us as naturally as breathing the keys training our subconscious mind are through repetition and positive self talk although people like jim jones adolph hitler and kim jong un have caused much chaos destruction and pain and suffering in the world may people believe them to be geniuses the reason for this is because they were so good at brainwashing but were they really geniuses you might be very surprised at just how easy it really is to brainwash someone and that it is even easier to brainwash yourself just like anything else that we learn to do throughout our lives repetition is needed stand in front of a mirror and repeat this phrase i am a successful add what ever you want to be i am so thankful that i have state what you have and or what you want to have i know that i can and will do anything that i set my mind to thank you lord or whatever you believe it for believing in me and for helping me to believe in myself thank you for giving me the drive and the perseverance to help me achieve full success in all of my endeavors once you know exactly what it is you want take this phrase and make it as specific as possible to what you want to achieve you can shorten this in any way that you like so as long as you keep the parts that you find most important to you also remember that you don t need to have accomplished these things already you are training your subconscious mind to believe that they have already happened so that your bodily actions will follow suit and make them happen this phrase may be difficult to believe the first couple times you say it to yourself but the longer and more often you stand in front of that mirror repeating this phrase the more you will start to believe it you will start to smile you will begin to feel excited about it once that feeling shows up say the phrase a few more times and then walk away if you stay in front of the mirror and repeat it for too long you may start doubting what you are doing walking away from the mirror at a moment you are feeling positive about what you are telling yourself will prevent that from happening so that in case you do start doubting you don t end up sending out a negative energy about it into the universe i still do this on a daily basis i still have my negative doubtful moments but when i do this it lifts my spirits even throughout the day while i m cleaning my house or grocery shopping i will say things like this to myself i m not sure if it s something that i will one day not need to do anymore or if it s something that even the people studying this for the last 30 years still need to do from time to time i just know that it works and that i will do it as long as needed this should be done anytime you notice your emotions slipping into a negative area you can use this for every aspect of your life sometimes i get a negative thought about the kind of wife and mother i am i try to catch myself in those moments and immediately turn my thoughts around by telling myself what a great wife and mother i am i just repeat the same thing over again until i feel happy about it then i let it go make sure that every time you use positive self talk which should be very often you thank the universe each and every time i don t just tell myself what a great wife and mother i am but i also thank my creator for what a great wife and mother i am and for bringing to me my beautiful family to begin with sometimes it is hard for us to catch ourselves in our negative thoughts that s what our feelings are there for obviously when we are feeling bad those feelings are being caused by our negative thoughts when you notice that you are in a bad mood or feeling down try and figure out what it is you are thinking that is causing these emotions in you use this to catch yourself and turn your thoughts around once your thoughts are turned around it makes it easier to turn your feelings around too this is also important to do for your physical health as well closing you can change your life in any which way that you believe you can you are no different than anyone else as they are no different from you we are all capable of absolute success it s only the one s who know this and believe with all of their hearts that they themselves can create their own greatness it is only those who believe themselves to be worthy of their own greatness and it is only those who expect nothing less than that create their own lives of pure greatness there are no impossible dreams keep in mind the more impossible something may seem at first is not only a possibility but it is exactly what you should be aiming for aim high expect high if you fail the first 100 times brush yourself off and do it again you are a magical creature who was born to do and become anything you wish you must first figure out what it is you truly want second you must make a solid vow to yourself that nothing will stand in your way third you must have complete and total faith that you are greater than you ever knew you were and more capable of anything that you ever thought before you must ask for everything you want in life then take all the steps to get you there as you have learned in this book it isn t as simple as asking believing and receiving there is much more to it but once you take the first step onto your desired road there is only one way to go continue going in that direction you so desire become the person you want to be want it with all your being ask for it believe that you will have it then let it go let the universe have complete control without wonder of when and how and i promise you will be given all the answers and tools you will need to get you to your desires be thankful for all that you already do have and don t fret over the things you don t have love and admire everyone without jealously the more you love and admire others the more others will love and admire you listen to your intuition when you have a gut or nagging feeling listen to it your intuition knows so much more than you give it credit for it knows the exact route to get you to where you want to go become the person you want to be live your life with dignity and believe in the possibilities of yourself and all others of the human race we are all connected use that because we are all connected you already possess the qualities you seek you simply need to find then within yourself so now go find them make them yours own them do this and you shall live your life with all the abundance that you were intended to create for yourself my best wishes to you and all the success you can handle good luck best regards jenny loveless note from the author i really enjoyed working

grateful to you for doing so here is to you and your very bright and fulfilled future ahead good luck and god bless ',\n",
       " ' payoff the hidden logic that shapes our motivations by ariely dan contents introduction from tragedy to meaning and motivation on the complexity of motivation and a personal story chapter 1 how to destroy motivation or work as a prison movie why it s astonishingly easy to demotivate someone chapter 2 the joy of even thinking that we are making something on our deep attachment to our own ideas and creations chapter 3 money is from mars pizza is from venus and compliments are from jupiter why money matters far less than we think chapter 4 on death relationships and meaning the crazy urge for symbolic immortality and how love conquers all epilogue the answer to the ultimate question the mystery of motivation in summary to the wonderful people in my life who have moved me forward backward and sideways i only wish i told you more clearly and frequently how much you mean to me introduction from tragedy to meaning and motivation on the complexity of motivation and a personal story we are the ceos of our own lives we work hard to spur ourselves to get up and go to work and do what we must do day after day we also try to encourage the people working for and with us those who are buying from and doing business with us and even those who regulate us we do this in our personal lives too from a very young age kids try to persuade their parents to do things for them dad i m too scared to do this or all the other kids are on snapchat with varying degrees of success as adults we try to encourage our significant others to do things for us sweetie i had such a stressful day today can you please put the kids to bed and do the dishes we attempt to get our kids to clean up their rooms and do their homework we try to induce our neighbors to trim their hedges or help out with a block party whatever our official job descriptions we are all part time motivators given that motivation is so central to our lives what do we really know about it what do we truly understand about how it operates and about its role in our lives the assumption about motivation is that it is driven by a positive external reward do this get that but what if the story of motivation is in fact much more intricate complex and fascinating than we ve assumed this book explores the jungle of motivation s true nature as well as our blindness to its strangeness and complexity rather than seeing motivation as a simple rat seeking reward equation my hope is to shed some light on this beautiful deeply human and psychologically complex world motivation is a forest full of twisting trees unexplored rivers threatening insects weird plants and colorful birds this forest has many elements that we think matter a lot but in fact don t even more it s full of unusual details that we either ignore completely or don t think matter but that turn out to be particularly important what is motivation exactly according to merriam webster s online dictionary the word is the act or process of giving someone a reason for doing something it s also the condition of being eager to act or work and so this book is about what moves us to feel enthusiastic about what we re doing it is about why we feel driven to slog through tasks that may appear on the surface to be thankless it s also about the dire need for managers to better understand the deeper nature of what makes employees feel engaged at work and what they can do to make everyone feel happier and more committed it s about connecting more deeply to what we do to the outcome of our efforts to others and to our relationships but ultimately this book is about what we really want out of life before we die 1 the motivation equation motivation in the sense of being positively engaged to complete a task is a much thornier problem than it seems at third glance to think about the complexity of motivation imagine that you are trying to write down an equation that would capture all of motivation s fundamental elements maybe it would look something like this motivation money achievement happiness purpose a sense of progress retirement security caring about others your legacy status number of young kids at home2 pride e p x all kinds of other elements of course money is an important part of this equation but this equation also includes a long list of factors such as achievement happiness purpose a sense of progress our relationships with our colleagues and so on think about your job for a few minutes if you wrote this equation for yourself how large would be the role that money plays in your motivation compared with the effect of achievement happiness purpose a sense of progress retirement security caring about others your legacy status etc as you can see the list is long it has many elements and we don t fully understand the types and range of incentives that motivate us much less how these different types of incentives interact with one another or add up to one big thing called motivation with a capital m the motivation equation also includes elements that appear not to have much to do with joy in fact one of the most fascinating things about motivation is that it often drives us to achievements that are difficult challenging and even painful for me this aspect of motivation is particularly interesting and important because it was one of the most challenging experiences of my life that ultimately helped me see the deep and wonderfully complex root of motivation allow me to explain called to a tragedy a few summers ago i was having dinner with a few old friends when my cell phone rang a woman i didn t know told me that she got my phone number from a mutual acquaintance she asked me to stop by the local hospital as soon as i could this woman had read about a trauma that affected me as a teenager and thought i d be able to offer some helpful advice to her best friend someone i ll call alice i deeply dislike hospitals for reasons that will soon become clear but my motivation to help was stronger than my aversion i couldn t refuse the request i left my friends and headed to the hospital when i met alice there i learned that she and her family had just suffered a terrible tragedy two of her teenage children had been badly burned in a fire after describing their condition to me to the best of her ability the distraught mother asked me what i thought she should tell her kids about their injuries they were drifting between consciousness and unconsciousness suffering awful pain and fear alice wanted to understand what they would want to know about their injuries about the treatments ahead and about their roads to recovery she also asked me what they would not want to know she asked me about these things because she had heard of my personal story many years earlier when i was a teenager about 70 percent of my body was burned as the result of an accident i spent about three years in a hospital during that time i underwent many treatments and surgeries and i had been in a very similar situation to that of alice s kids i did not know how to answer her questions but i did my best to transport myself back in time to my own early days in the hospital i remembered the noises the hums and beeps of the machines the equipment the pain the sounds of my fears the phrase pain person echoed in my mind it was a phrase that i must have heard at some point from the medical staff and i took it to mean that i was someone who was completely engulfed in the intensity of the pain everything was defined by pain and there was nothing else no past and no future there was only the pain of the moment nothing else one memory that came rushing at me from those early days in the hospital was the daily removal of my bandages because i had no skin the bandages adhered to my raw flesh the nurses would rip off the bandages then rub the freshly wounded flesh to remove the dead tissue until they saw bleeding a sign that the underlying tissue was alive they would then put ointment on the wounds and rebandage my body the next day they would repeat this agonizing process the only time i had a reprieve from the torture was on the days i had surgery and sometimes the day after oh how i looked forward to surgery the bliss of anesthesia and the few days of recovery i did not share my memories of the bandage removal with alice but i did tell her that when i was in the hospital i wanted to know the meaning of all the noises and beeps around me i wanted to know my heart rate and blood pressure i wanted to know the level of oxygen in my blood the functioning of my lungs and so on i wanted to know which sounds meant that my body was functioning and which indicated that things were not going well i also wanted to know how long the pain would continue when a treatment would cause the pain to increase and when i would have some relief at the superficial level it seemed that i yearned for information about what was happening to me but what i really wanted in contrast to my almost motionless experience in the hospital bed was to have some feeling of control i described all of these things to alice before i left a few days later alice called me weeping she asked me to return to the hospital when i arrived she told me that one of her kids had just passed away she asked me whether she should tell her surviving son i ll call him bill about his brother s death i had no idea what to say but again i tried to transport myself back in time i tried to think about how in that world of pain and difficulty of breathing and falling in and out of consciousness of machines and being intubated of hallucinations and painkillers i might have dealt with news of such magnitude i couldn t comprehend how anyone could handle the grief of losing a sibling on top of such pain and confusion so i suggested that she keep the news from him as long as possible a few months later i got some better news bill was out of immediate danger fully conscious and more or less aware of his situation she asked me to send her son an optimistic note about his recovery and his future her request overwhelmed me with sadness i knew all too well that this kid was just beginning to heal and that the road ahead would be long and brutal it was going to be much harder than any of them imagined what could possibly motivate me to revisit the suffering i d endured as i reflected on alice s request i remembered the first time i walked out of my hospital room by myself i got out of bed and shuffled to the door opened it and stepped out proceeding very very slowly and painfully i was determined to make it all the way to the nurse s station when i got there i saw a big mirror without thinking i took another step and looked at myself it was hard to believe that the creature in the mirror was seventeen year old me up to that point i had seen different sections of my body from time to time but this was the first time i had a full view i saw legs that were deeply bent and covered with bandages and arms that appeared to be dangling lifelessly from my shoulders my back was hunched over and my face was a rainbow of colors the right side was completely blue and red and yellow pus oozed from different places pieces of skin hung from my face my right eye was swollen shut only the left eye stuck in this strange disguise seemed recognizable the rest was very very different than the healthy person i once was it didn t look like an injured me because there was almost no resemblance to how i remembered myself it looked like someone else only it wasn t after staring at the thing in the mirror for a few more moments i couldn t stand the pain in my legs anymore i turned around and shuffled as fast as i could back to the bed where i struggled with pain for the next few hours this time pain was my rescue unable to think about anything else i returned to being a pain person i also remembered how about a year and a half later my scars were almost completely closed and i was in a much much better state but the improvements and the increased hope that came with feeling healthier were also accompanied by new and unexpected challenges my scars now red thick and slightly raised had somehow developed the ability to shrink very quickly every time i would sit with my arms or legs bent for an hour or two maybe watching tv or just resting i wouldn t be able to straighten my limbs and neck because the scars would shrink just a little bit limiting my range of movement to get the scars to stretch back to their previous length i would have to push and push against them trying to straighten my arms and legs while almost tearing my skin sometimes i couldn t completely regain my range of movement when this happened i d have to undergo a new operation to remove some of the tightened skin and replace it with new skin only to go through the whole process again i hated fighting my body all the time it was betraying me and i loathed the daily never ending fight torturous as the memories were they also drove me to try to help alice and bill alice wanted me to send bill a hopeful positive note but knowing what i knew i asked myself how optimistic should i be what could i tell him how honest could and should i be the reality was that he was probably going to have a deeply miserable life for a very long time i thought about all the treatments that i still had to undergo thirty years after the accident it was not clear to me whether he was better off alive or dead thoughts that i had had for years about my own painful existence and it was not clear to me that his prolonged agony another thought that i had had about myself was better for him or his family over the next forty eight hours as i relived my own experiences and struggled with what to say to bill i cried a lot i wept more than i had in years finally i came up with an outline for a message with which i was comfortable because i can t use my hands very well i recorded a voice message to him and emailed it to alice i started by telling bill that his life was going to be tough and that progress would be slow but there was a way to live with his injury i told him that technology helps everyone but that it helps people with disabilities even more i also told him that the modern workplace makes it possible to work and function in new and flexible ways that fit people with our kinds of challenges i said for example i chose the life of a university professor because it creates tremendous flexibility in my life i can work more when i feel better and less when i am in pain on top of that while i can t use my hands very well i can use voice technology to help me write my books and papers and this technology is only getting better the whole process of creating my message for bill was tremendously distressing and i felt a great relief the moment i pressed the send button alice replied two days later telling me how much my note had helped her son and how much she appreciated it she asked me to send him another one and despite the difficulty of the first one i have been sending him messages ever since a few months later i went to see bill in the hospital i didn t get much sleep the night before because i was torn between my desires to help on one hand and my deep worry about how i would react to seeing him i had been back to hospitals quite a few times but only as a patient not as a visitor to my surprise the visit with bill was quite good we talked about all kinds of topics the hospital life outside its walls family and the complexity of living with injuries and treatments after a few hours a nurse came in and told bill that he was going to have a new type of treatment one that i remembered having myself it was clear to everyone in the room that this new treatment would be painful can we put it off a little bit maybe until tomorrow he asked plaintively i m sorry bill no it has to be right now can t we just wait an hour or so the nurse shook her head do we have to do it all over can t we just do one part of my body no i m sorry sweetie at that point i couldn t take it anymore i became so anxious that i was unable to stand i sat down placed my hands on my knees and put my head down trying to breathe slowly i remembered all the times i tried to negotiate with the nurses myself trying to delay the treatment reduce the pain asking for only certain parts of my body to be treated on that day like bill i failed almost every time the nurses concession was not an option as i walked away from the hospital trying to contain my emotions i realized something new about my injury and the way it changed my life up to that point when i thought about my own suffering i had just focused on the pain i thought about shrinking scars i wondered what i looked like to other people i thought about the difficulty of being unable to regulate my body s temperature and the limitations of my movements all the physical aspects of the injury but observing bill s failed negotiation i realized the devastating role that helplessness played in my own experience it made me more deeply appreciate the challenges of being badly injured the complexity of recovery and the ways that my experience had deeply changed me i also realized how many of our motivations spring from trying to conquer a sense of helplessness and reclaim even a tiny modicum of control over our lives pain and meaning what does my story have to do with human motivation it shows how deeply we are driven to tap into a sense of meaning even when doing so is challenging and painful it also shows that there is a big difference between happiness and meaning you might think that you would be happy to spend all your time sitting on a beautiful beach drinking mojitos feel free to replace with a different activity of your choice and that as long as you get to fill your days this way you would be happy forever but while a few days of hedonic bliss might be fun from time to time i can t imagine that you would be fulfilled by spending your days weeks months years and life this way while perhaps unintuitive research that examines the differences between meaning and happiness finds that the things that give us a sense of meaning don t necessarily make us happy moreover people who report having meaningful lives are often more interested in doing things for others while those who focus mostly on doing things for themselves report being only superficially happy 3 of course meaning is a slippery concept but its essential quality has to do with having a sense of purpose value and impact of being involved in something bigger than the self the german philosopher friedrich nietzsche argued that life s greatest rewards spring from our experience of adversity in my case the stinging smell of the oily unguents hearing bill s screams and moans seeing the empathic agony of his family brought me back to my own miserable experiences it was all pretty terrible but eventually through my conversations with bill and his family i achieved a complex but unique emotional lift that stemmed from shared pain i became motivated by a feeling of identification and empathy for them i felt that my own suffering had not been pointless and that i could do something to help other human beings something that i m uniquely qualified to do we all know people who garner a great sense of meaning even in the most unpleasant of circumstances a friend of mine who works as a hospice volunteer for example has spent years in companionship with people as they go through their last steps in life she sits through long nights at their bedsides holding their hands and singing softly to them she sees herself as the midwife of death it s the other end of birth she says and i feel lucky to help them go through that door other volunteers clean smelly sticky stuff off oil soaked birds following a spill many people spend portions of their lives working in dangerous war torn areas trying to keep disease and death from innocent civilians or teaching orphans to read their pain is real their sense of doing something truly meaningful is substantial they demonstrate how our ingrained desire to believe that our lives have purpose beyond our life span drives us to work extra hard even to the point of our own personal suffering in order to gain more meaning even my nurses adhering to their higher calling of healing me clearly didn t enjoy ripping those bandages off while i screamed and begged them to stop as awful as the experience was it is also clear that they weren t trying to hurt me they were doing their jobs as compassionate people working hard to make my life better it certainly would have been much easier for them to delay the treatments a bit leave the most painful parts for another day and accept my deep gratitude for putting off the pain but they didn t they carried on with their difficult job despite its horrors and over the years brought me to a much better place the point is that these seemingly odd and irrational motivations get us to do things that are complex difficult and unpleasant but they go beyond helping people in need they motivate us in every aspect of our lives whether in our personal relationships in our individual pursuits or in the workplace this is because human motivation is actually based on a time scale that is long sometimes even longer than our lifetimes we re motivated by meaning and connection because their effects extend beyond ourselves beyond our social circle and maybe even beyond our existence we care deeply about meaning we care about it more as we become aware of our own mortality and if we have to go to hell and back in a search for meaning and connection we will and we will get deep satisfaction along the way in the end human motivation is not simple but as we understand it more we ll better be able to handle ourselves our work our relationships our employers and our employees knowing what drives us and others is an essential step toward enhancing the inherent joy and minimizing the confusion in our lives 1 how to destroy motivation or work as a prison movie why it s astonishingly easy to demotivate someone life is never made unbearable by circumstances but only by lack of meaning and purpose viktor e frankl a few years ago i was invited to speak about the topic of decision making to a group of a few hundred engineers at a big seattle based software firm during the years before i met them the mandate for this carefully recruited experienced and brainy bunch had been to create something fabulously innovative that would become the next big thing for this staid software company the engineers dove into the challenge with enthusiasm they conducted tons of research they built an almost working prototype they were all proud of their work having spent long hours including evenings and weekends away from their families to make this awesome thing happen they believed their invention would transform their company and make it the innovation giant it should have been after a short introduction i started talking about some research that i was working on i began by describing a set of experiments that emir kamenica a professor at the university of chicago drazen prelec a professor at mit and i had carried out studies that unexpectedly resonated with the engineers 4 in these experiments we asked participants to build some lego bionicles these are marvelously weird lego creatures that kids can creatively assemble in many different ways we picked bionicles as the object of our investigation because the joy of lego is almost universal across cultures and ages and because building with them resembles at least conceptually the creative process that is so central to innovation in the workplace we divided the participants into two different conditions we offered the participants in one group 2 for the first bionicle they built we told them that at the end of the experiment we would disassemble the bionicles put the pieces back in the box and use the same bionicle parts for the next participant the participants seemed perfectly happy with this process after these participants assembled their first bionicle we placed their completed creations under the table for later disassembly we then asked would you like to build another one this time for eleven cents less for 1 89 if the person said yes we gave him another one and when they finished that one we asked do you want to build another this time for 1 78 another for 1 67 and so on at some point the participants said no more it s not worth it for me on average participants in this condition built eleven bionicles for a total take home pay of a bit more than 14 the participants in the second condition were promised the same amount of money per bionicle so they had the same financial incentive but this time as soon as they finished building a bionicle and started working on the next one we began disassembling their completed bionicle right before their eyes once we finished undoing their work we placed the parts back in the box the first group built their bionicles in what we called the meaningful condition so called because they were allowed to feel that they had completed their work satisfactorily we called the second condition the sisyphic condition named after the ancient greek story about sisyphus who was condemned by the gods to roll a boulder up a hill only to have it roll down again and again for eternity those in the sisyphic condition managed to build an average of seven bionicles four fewer than those in the meaningful condition as i described this experiment to the engineers i added that we also looked at individual differences in terms of lego love some people are naturally enthusiastic about building bionicles while others not so much we wanted to see how this individual difference translated to productivity in the meaningful condition some participants were unenthusiastic about making bionicles so they made fewer of them in contrast those who loved making these creations were happy to assemble them for relatively small amounts of money basically people who loved the task kept on going because they enjoyed the process and found meaning in it of course we weren t talking about meaning with a capital m these folks weren t curing cancer or building bridges they were building plastic toys and they understood that their creatures would be taken apart quite soon but here s what was so interesting in the sisyphic condition we discovered that there was no relationship between the internal joy of making bionicles and productivity those who weren t terribly excited about bionicles created about seven of them the same number as those who loved building them in general we should expect that those who love bionicles would build more of them but by dismantling their creations right before their eyes we crushed any joy that the bionicle loving participants could get out of this otherwise fun activity as i was describing these results one of the chief engineers stopped me we completely understand the experiment you re talking about he said because we ve all just been part of the sisyphic condition they all nodded in sorrowful agreement the chief engineer continued talking last week our ceo told us that our project was canceled that the whole initiative was going to be scrapped and that soon we would be assigned to other projects up to that point i had wondered why the people sitting in front of me were so lethargic and depressed now i understood your situation i told them is also the way that some movies depict breaking the spirit of prisoners does anyone here remember the famous prison yard scene from the movie the last castle several people nodded in the movie robert redford plays the role of eugene irwin a court martialed three star lieutenant general who is sentenced to ten years in prison soon after he is imprisoned he challenges the warden over the bad treatment of prisoners and is punished for insubordination his punishment is to move enormous rocks from one side of the prison yard to another the task is so daunting that many of the prisoners think he will pass out before finishing others cheer him on after hours of back breaking work irwin manages a final push of energy he pulls up the last huge rock carries it across the yard and drops it triumphantly onto the pile the prisoners go wild it looks like a happy ending until a few seconds later when the warden tells the prisoner he s not finished with the job and orders him to put the rocks back irwin continues to move the rocks back until sunset but though he accomplishes this harsh punishment there is no sign of triumph from him or his fellow prisoners what added to the torture i explained to the engineers wasn t just that he had to carry all those terribly heavy rocks it was the fact that the goal of moving them from one side of the prison yard to the other was taken away and by forcing irwin to put the rocks back the warden drained him and all the prisoners of any potential feeling of accomplishment making the victory a hollow one this type of futile battle is the same as sisyphus s i added if sisyphus were pushing his rock up a new hill every time he would have a sense of progress but because he keeps pushing the same rock up the same hill over and over his work is completely meaningless that s when i overheard one of the engineers sitting in the front row mumble to another so we re basically working in a prison movie shredding motivation the connection between our experiments and how events unfolded in the lives of the software engineers was uncanny i immediately felt both connected to them and sorry for them as their work had been brutally robbed of meaning i am not sure whether at that point in the conversation i should have moved to a less charged topic but i was so fascinated by the unexpected match between our bionicle experiments and the engineers experience that i decided to push forward and describe a few more experiments on motivation and futility at work in another experiment we printed letters in random order on many sheets of paper i explained we then asked participants to find pairs of identical letters that were next to each other when participants finished the first sheet they were paid 55 cents we then asked them if they wanted to do another sheet for 5 cents less and so on this was the same diminishing payment approach we used in the bionicles experiment just with a different task and different amounts of money in this experiment we had three conditions in the acknowledged condition each participant wrote their name on the top left of the sheet found all the pairs of letters they could and then walked over to the experimenter and gave the paper to him the experimenter looked at it carefully from top to bottom said uh huh and placed it facedown on a pile on the left side of his desk he then asked the participant if he or she wanted to work on another sheet for five cents less or if they would rather stop and get paid for their work if the participant wanted another sheet the process continued the ignored condition was slightly less meaningful this time the participants didn t write their names down and when they handed in their sheets the experimenter didn t even look at their papers he simply placed them facedown in a pile on the left side of his desk without any kind of acknowledgment we called the last and most extreme condition the shredded condition in this condition when participants handed their sheets to the experimenter they were not acknowledged at all the experimenter just inserted the sheets into a large shredder next to his desk he then turned to the participants and asked if they wanted to do another sheet for a payment of 5 cents less you might reason that those in the ignored condition would have quickly learned once they completed their first sheet that they could cheat no one was checking their work so why bother finding all the pairs of letters why not earn more money for less work you could also reason that the temptation to cheat would be even stronger for those in the shredded condition why not shirk and get paid for doing nothing if this were the case we thought we would find that participants in the ignored and shredded conditions would have chosen to work longer for less money but did they here is what we found in the acknowledged condition participants stopped when the pay rate fell to around 15 cents indicating that doing more was not worth their time in contrast participants in the shredded condition stopped working far earlier at about 29 cents these results show that when we are acknowledged for our work we are willing to work harder for less pay and when we are not acknowledged we lose much of our motivation what about the ignored condition you might think it would be somewhere between the acknowledged and the shredded conditions but where would the results fall closer to the acknowledged or to those of the shredded condition perhaps exactly in the middle in fact participants who experienced the ignored condition stopped working when the payment per page was around 27 5 cents only 1 5 cents less than the participants whose work was shredded this suggests that if you really want to demotivate people shredding their work is the way to go but that you can get almost all the way there simply by ignoring their efforts acknowledgment is a kind of human magic a small human connection a gift from one person to another that translates into a much larger more meaningful outcome on the positive side these results also show that we can increase motivation simply by acknowledging the efforts of those working with us as i described these results and their implications the software engineers looked increasingly grumpy sadly there are many employees of many companies in the same state according to gallup which has been collecting data on employee engagement for many years american workers are generally unmotivated in their jobs a problem that has risen steadily by about 2 percent a year since gallup began examining this issue in 2000 today more than 50 percent of employees are disengaged while only about 17 percent are actively disengaged 5 negative motivation is a big deal because when people are disengaged they show up late they leave early they fail to keep on top of their expense accounts they do the least that they can and sometimes they even actively sabotage their employers why are people so demotivated at work i think it s partially because of the persistence of an industrial era view of labor that is largely accepted as truth this view holds that the labor market is a place where individuals exchange work for wages regardless of how meaningless the labor is and that people typically don t really care what happens to their work as long as they are fairly compensated for it this view of labor as a work wage exchange springs from adam smith s 1776 magnum opus the wealth of nations in which smith described the benefits of breaking a large task into components assigning one person to each specific task and encouraging them to specialize in performing it in his famous example of the pin factory smith argued that having one person make every part of a pin would result in low productivity in contrast he envisioned an efficient workplace built on a division of labor it looked like this one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving a head 6 from the perspective of the factory owner in the industrial revolution this approach of breaking tasks into components and letting people specialize in their specific tasks bit by bit and hour after hour yielded a lot of efficiency gains but from the workers point of view this approach meant that they were nothing more than cogs in a wheel they were working only to earn a wage with no real sense of how their tasks fit into the big picture from this industrial era point of view capitalism and labor were based on a simple equation individuals needed and wanted stuff companies made and shipped the stuff people wanted laborers worked at dismal jobs for long hours so they could buy stuff workers were assumed to view work as unpleasant but the reward was assumed to be so important a paycheck that it was worth suffering through to achieve it and then exchange it for stuff it s astonishing to me how some ideas endure even when it s obvious that they are no longer relevant smith s industrial era view of labor has been passed down for generations as an indisputable truth but as our experiments and many others show there is a lot more to work than money and things to buy as the great economist john maynard keynes observed if human nature felt no temptation to take a chance no satisfaction profit apart in constructing a factory a railway a mine or a farm there might not be much investment as a result of cold calculation enterprise only pretends to itself to be mainly motivated by the statement in its own prospectus 7 this is how i explained to the software engineers how their motivation equation got distorted first i asked them for their reflections these days how many of you show up to work later than you used to i asked everybody raised their hands how many of you now go home earlier than you used to again they all raised their hands how many of you now add not so kosher things to your expense reports this time no one raised a hand but later a few of them took me out to dinner and showed me how creative they could be with their expense accounts let s assume for the moment i continued that your ceo had to cancel the project for all kinds of legitimate reasons unbeknownst to you what could he have done to make you less depressed about this outcome was there a way for him to cancel the project without demotivating you to this degree he could have asked us to build some next generation prototypes and test how they would work someone suggested he could have asked us to think about which aspect of the technology we ve been working on could fit with other projects in other parts of the organization another engineer said he could have asked us to make a presentation to the whole company about our journey over the last two years another offered all of these are reasonable suggestions i said the problem is that each of these could require more expenditure of time money and effort and it seems like your ceo doesn t see the value in investing more in this project simply because he doesn t understand the value of investing in your motivation that s when i told them about another fascinating experiment this one didn t involve actual bionicles or any physical tasks it was a prediction experiment during which we ask people to forecast the outcome of a particular experiment understanding predictions is important because we often face situations that force us to make decisions based on our intuition without the ability to first test our hunches for example let s say you re a high school student thinking about going to college you ve read a lot about different schools and have even gone to visit two universities you know a bit about each of them but you don t really know how it would feel to study at either in terms of the quality of instruction culture of the student body and range of social activities so you have to rely on your intuition which may or may not correspond with reality in fact we have to use our intuition every time we don t have sufficient data which is much of the time in the intuition experiment we first described the procedures in the sisyphic and the meaningful conditions to the participants though we didn t explain the reasoning behind them then we asked them to imagine that they worked as consultants for a company that owned a bionicle assembly facility that facility used the sisyphic method of production identical to our experiment we also told them that there was another assembly facility for sale one that was not owned by their client this other production facility used the meaningful method of production in a way that was identical to our experiment we asked the consultants to predict by how much the number of assembled bionicles would change if the client switched from their current sisyphic assembly facility to the meaningful one would the number increase or decrease and by how much to answer this question the participants had to intuit the motivation of the employees in both conditions and then predict the difference in the number of bionicles created in the two production facilities basically they had to predict the results of our original bionicle experiment as it turned out participants in this forecasting experiment thought that employees moving from a sisyphic factory to a meaningful one would create only one more bionicle and as a consequence they suggested that the ceo should pay just a tiny bit more to switch from the sisyphic to the meaningful facility in the real life bionicle experiment production increased by about four bionicles in other words when trying to intuit the outcome of these different conditions participants predicted that the effect of meaning would be much smaller than it actually was they greatly underestimated the power of meaning this is important i told the engineers because if your ceo is working according to his intuition and not data and if his intuition is the same as that of the participants in our consultant experiment this means that he may be systematically underestimating the importance of meaning at work the consultant experiment i continued showed that people dramatically underappreciate the extent and depth to which a feeling of accomplishment influences people your ceo most likely reasoned that people who work for him are like rats in a maze only instead of working for food you work for a salary if he wants you to start working toward a different goal he probably thinks that all he needs to do is to direct you down a new path and you will quickly start working toward the new goal he seems not to appreciate the effect that stopping your big project would have on your internal motivation the heads around the room nodded the engineers felt that they had been working in an environment somewhere between our bionicle experiment and adam smith s pin factory it is true that these engineers jobs were much more interesting and that they received higher wages than our experimental participants or smith s pin makers not to mention their social and health benefits and the ample free t shirts emblazoned with the company s logo but their creation was taken apart before their eyes they never got to see the equivalent of their pins finally assembled for a moment close your eyes and imagine that you are one of those software engineers you re in your late thirties or early forties maybe with a young family at home you ve worked very hard through high school and college to earn great grades in computer science maybe you even earned an advanced degree when the company hires you you re proud to have been selected because you know it has a reputation for hiring the cream of the crop you buy a house in the seattle area a big investment that represents your commitment to stay at the firm for a while you work hard every day often during evenings and weekends to meet your deadlines you ve built strong connections with your colleagues you may even define your identity in relation to your workplace as the end of the big two year project nears you feel increasingly confident in the value of what you and your fellow engineers are creating and then the ceo makes his stupefying announcement when that happens you feel as if all that investment what you ve put into your work your home your education and those collegial relationships goes pfffft like a deflated balloon it s not just the feeling of wasted work that disturbs you nor is it even what one may see as the ceo s blindness it s the sense that your own life matters less that who you are has been belittled somehow you haven t been working just for a paycheck or even a vision for the company you ve been working for yourself by building something that you cared about and now all of this is gone the ceo s announcement snatches away not only your sense of trust meaning accomplishment connection and pride but also some of your longer term dreams and hopes given all of this it s hardly surprising that some of the most innovative and senior engineers now feeling negatively motivated quit the company a few weeks after my visit what is labor for the experiments i described to the engineers were all about actions that crush our natural motivation nobody can gain a deep sense of meaning with a capital m from building bionicles nor can anyone find a true sense of purpose from finding identical adjacent letters on sheets of paper but the experiments told us a lot about how little it takes to kill even the tiniest enthusiasm there is also no question in my mind that the lessons from the software engineers as well as the bionicle and shredding experiments apply to many work environments with this in mind we should systematically and carefully look for places where by not thinking carefully about our incentives we unintentionally damage motivation and productivity for example i know one very large company that takes its organizational hierarchy very seriously they assign a number to each employee to reflect their level in the organizational hierarchy and they use the organizational chart as the company s directory this way every time someone looks for a name email etc they are reminded that they are at level x that they are substitutable with other people at level x that they are only a small part of a huge organization that there are many layers above them in the company s hierarchy and when they contact someone their relative place in the hierarchy and not their skill or contribution dictates the tone of the discussion another sad example that reduces motivation is the dilbert style identical cubicle that continuously reminds people that they are low in the hierarchy not important enough to justify any investment in them that the company is not expecting them to be around for a long time and that they are basically replaceable cubicles are highly efficient of course from a space allocation perspective but they don t add much to people s day one company i know took the art of using cubicles to kill motivation to a higher level they found out that employees had all kinds of personal mementoes on their desks so the management redid the cubicles and made them 20 percent smaller with less space for anything personal but more space for more people another company came up with an even more brilliant idea that nobody could own their own cubicle designing the system such that those who showed up to work earliest in the morning could claim the ones closest the windows none of the cubicles has anything but a desk a place to connect a computer and a chair no one could establish a sense of connection to their workspace ultimately by setting the atmosphere this way the company communicated to the employees that they are valued only for their direct productivity and that they are easily replaceable the good news is that we don t have to fall into these common motivation killing traps there are all kinds of things that companies can do to reinforce the feelings of meaning and connection in their employees one important way to do this is to treat them as unique individuals not to be used but rather to be appreciated and respected for their creativity and intelligence at the offices of zappos for example employees are encouraged to be weird they decorate their cubicles in all kinds of wonderful adventurous ways stuffed animals hang from ceilings balloons are everywhere the company looks like a cross between a party supply store and a toy shop all in the service of fostering employees sense of individuality and creativity you might think that only little kids are motivated by this kind of environment but the truth is that we never really grow up a creative space coupled with a kind word genuine appreciation the feeling of progress and achievement the forces that motivate us are the same throughout our lives in the adult world companies are pseudo parents and they can be nurturing or quashing enlightened or limiting by focusing on that which gives us a sense of meaning and connection we will not only stop destroying motivation but we can start growing more of this incredible resource there is plenty of marvelous human energy lying dormant within most of us and once those of us who are parents teachers and managers learn how to better tap into it the better off we will all be how to motivate yourself from time to time we find ourselves bored and unmotivated at work or at home like sisyphus we end up doing the same humdrum unrewarding thing over and over what can we do to change the situation when it is impossible to change the circumstances the answer change your mental framing for example a young man i know recently took a job at a hospital disposing of waste and cleaning surgical equipment after a few months on the job he found it so boring that he considered quitting but his mother reminded him that he had one of the most important jobs in the hospital because people in hospitals are especially vulnerable to killer germs like staph without his important work she explained these patients could easily become sicker and die this shift in perspective renewed his pride in his job he performed it with more energy and not too long afterward he received a promotion this example suggests that if we are feeling bored and unmotivated we can ask ourselves how is the work i m doing helping someone down the road what meaning can i find here with this type of mind set chances are that we will be able to find a positive answer we can also try to find a creative or learning opportunity in our sisyphic experience i once asked a broadway actor how he managed to perform the same play night after night month after month and year after year without getting bored i was looking for tips because i was getting bored with giving lectures the actor told me that he thought about doing something differently each time he performed he experimented with different gestures timing and pauses different emphases on words or passages and different approaches to his character he also took mental notes on how his little tweaks went over with the audience in that way the work became much more interesting borrowing from him i now do the same thing by gauging students reactions to my little adjustments i find that my routine work becomes much more interesting both to them and to me 2 the joy of even thinking that we are making something on our deep attachment to our own ideas and creations while reducing the harmful elements on motivation should be our first step we also need to look closely at the positive side of motivation and think of ways to increase it by understanding the building blocks of motivation we can structure both our workplaces and our personal lives in ways that will make us more productive more fulfilled and happier but how can we increase motivation to answer this question let s think again about building something this time not a piece of software or a bionicle but a piece of ikea furniture ikea came up with a brilliantly diabolical idea the company would offer boxes of bionicle like furniture parts and make customers assemble the pieces by themselves with only the help of their bitterly impossible to understand instructions i like the clean simple design of ikea furniture when i see it in their showrooms but long ago i found that assembling a piece of ikea furniture in my case a chest of drawers for my kids toys demands a surprising amount of time and effort i still remember how confused i was by the instructions that came with the chest some parts seemed to be missing i put some pieces together the wrong way more than once overall i can t say that i enjoyed the process but when i finally finished building the piece i experienced a somewhat odd and unexpected sense of satisfaction i stood back looking at the chest and smiled with pride at having completed the job over the years i ve noticed that i look at that chest of drawers more often and more fondly than any other piece of furniture in my house my colleagues mike norton a professor at harvard university daniel mochon a professor at tulane university and i described the general over fondness we have for stuff we ve made ourselves as the ikea effect and while ikea inspired our original research ikea was hardly the first to understand the value of self assembly consider the history of cake mixes back in the 1940s when most women worked at home a company called p duff and sons introduced boxed cake mixes the mixes were almost ready made housewives had only to add water stir up the mix in a bowl pour the batter into a cake pan bake it at 350 degrees for half an hour and voilà they had a tasty dessert to serve to their family and friends but surprisingly these mixes didn t sell well the reason had nothing to do with the taste it had to do with the complexity of the process but not in the way we usually think about complexity duff discovered that the 40s era housewives felt that the just add water cakes were a shade shy of buying ready made from a store sure the cakes emerged warm from the oven and the mix saved time but the completed cakes did not feel like the housewives own creations there was simply too little effort involved to confer a sense of creation and meaningful ownership to solve this problem the company took the eggs and milk powder out of the mix and put the new harder to use mix on supermarket shelves this time when the housewives added fresh eggs oil and real milk they felt like they d participated in the making and were much happier with the end product when someone told them what a delicious cake you made they could smile and respond it s an ancient family recipe they didn t just accept the compliment they believed they deserved it 8 the duff cake mix story offers a simple and clear example of the power of effort and ownership and how it relates to motivation it shows that when we work harder and spend a bit more time and effort we feel a greater sense of ownership and thus enjoy more the fruits of our efforts my beautiful creature to examine the ikea effect in a more controlled experimental way daniel mike and i asked participants to work for us by making some origami creations in exchange for an hourly wage we equipped them with colored paper and standard written origami instructions that showed where to crease the paper and the direction to fold it in order to create paper cranes and frogs and off they went now folding a piece of paper into an elegant creation is harder than it looks and since these participants were all origami novices none of their creations was a terribly satisfying work of art when their temporary employment ended we told them look this origami crane you just made really belongs to us because we paid you for your time but we ll tell you what we might be persuaded to sell it to you please write down the maximum amount of money that you would be willing to pay in order to take your origami creation home with you we called these people builders and we contrasted their enthusiasm for their origami creatures as measured by their willingness to pay for them with that of a more objective group we called buyers buyers were people who had not made any origami they simply evaluated the builders creations and indicated how much they would be willing to pay for them it turned out that the builders were willing to pay five times more for their handmade creations than the buyers were 9 now imagine that you are one of these origami builders imbued with such a deep affection and overvaluation for your work do you recognize that other people don t see your lovely creation in the same way that you do or do you mistakenly think that everyone shares your appreciation before answering this question consider toddlers little kids have an egocentric perspective they believe that when they close their eyes and can t see other people other people can t see them as children grow older they outgrow that kind of egocentric bias but do we ever get rid of it completely we don t we found that the egocentric bias is also alive and well in adults love for one s handiwork is indeed blind our builders not only overvalued their own creations they also erroneously believed other people would love their origami art as much as they did but wait there s more in the impossible version of this experiment we made the origami folding task more complex by eliminating some of the most crucial details of the instructions the standard set of instructions for origami includes arrows and arcs that tell the user what to fold and in which direction the usual instructions also include a legend that tells the user how to interpret these arrows and arcs in this more difficult version we eliminated the legend making the instructions useless and the whole process much harder this time our participants creations were even uglier as a consequence buyers were willing to pay even less for the origami but such objectivity was lost on the builders in this impossible version the builders valued their creations even more than when they had been given clear instructions because they put extra effort into making them just as my working hard on the ikea chest of drawers increased my affection for the damned thing our origami experiments showed that the more effort people expend the more they seem to care about their creations it is important to note that our experiments with bionicles paper shredding and origami weren t connected in any way to one of the main drivers of motivation our larger sense of identity these tasks weren t life callings integral to participants sense of themselves yet our participants behavior clearly revealed that we are strongly motivated by identity the need for recognition a sense of accomplishment and feeling of creation the finding that these needs played such large roles in our lab experiments suggests to me that the same thing happens in real world work environments but in spades if for example you re a software engineer who has spent two years of your life working on a project your identity is likely to be many times more powerfully connected to your creation than our participants identities were to bionicles or paper frogs zappos as we mentioned earlier is a company that shows deep appreciation for the forces and complexity of motivation as a place that wants very much to attract and keep talent it focuses hard on employees as individuals and does everything it can to make people feel connected and happy if someone is struggling with anything from weight loss to learning to write better he or she can work with a coach the facility in las vegas is designed to encourage connections and collisions so that as employees get up from their desks and walk around they meet and exchange ideas employees are encouraged to do anything they can to wow customers nobody takes customer service calls using a phone script people are paid extra for learning new ideas and presenting what they learn to others in hallways you can find makeshift bowling alleys employees wear costumes to work one of zappos s core values is create fun and a little weirdness zappos understands that we are all toddlers at heart driven by play and a dash of individuality all of these things make zappos one of the best companies to work for according to fortune magazine the creating consumer it s easy to see how creators can garner a strong connection and a sense of identity and meaning from their accomplishments it s also easy to see how this research applies to artists craftspeople and hobbyists but what about the stuff we personalize as consumers henry ford reportedly said any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black those days are long gone now we can pick not only the color of our cars but the interior layout the number of cup holders the design of the wheel rims and more if you buy a pair of shoes online from nike you can customize the colors of the shoes laces and linings a website called chocomize lets you create your own special candy m m s lets you pick your color mix at zazzle you can customize garments and cards to make them uniquely yours crowdfunding platforms now allow us to play roles in all kinds of creative projects from art and fashion to film games technology and more initially this desire to customize seems to be about preferences we choose red over purple because we like red more but the reality is that customization has additional benefits by choosing red we make the product a little more our own and every time we choose a new color for our shoes we personalize them even more the more effort we put into the design the more likely we are to enjoy the end product so just think 3 d printing is developing so quickly that one day as consumers we will soon not just design but also manufacture all kinds of products from picture frames to clothing to furniture and beyond regardless of what these objects might end up looking like they will be much more meaningful to us than anything someone else has made because they will have the stamp of our own effort design care and unique identity home sweat home what kind of creation could be more customized and personal than a home the intimacy and care with which we design our living spaces make home ownership an especially keen demonstration of the motivational power of creation when i worked at mit in cambridge massachusetts my wife sumi and i owned a house close to the university we loved the house and went to a great deal of inconvenience and expense to customize it we renovated rooms removed walls and enlarged windows after it was done to the extent that renovations are ever done we marveled at the open airy feeling we d created a few years later when we moved to duke university in durham north carolina we had to sell the cambridge house it sat on the market for a disturbingly long time after several months our real estate agent pointed out that most people didn t want to live with an open floor plan and recommended that we reinstall a few walls to make the space more closed and sectional we were certain that she was wrong who would not appreciate the beauty of our open floor plan who would not love the feeling of warmth that comes from being able to see your children playing in the other areas of the house so we resisted her suggestion for a while eventually we decided to follow her advice and as soon as we added walls and closed up some rooms a buyer snatched it up the lesson just like the origami builders sumi and i too have an egocentric bias our taste is most likely just our taste and very few people share it but it was hard for us to truly appreciate and understand this here s another fun ownership story from the annals of our cambridge home improvement efforts over the years our renovations included many additional projects including insulating the attic installing a better heating system renovating a bathroom and most excitingly installing a sauna in the basement the whole process involved all the typical delights that accompany such projects broken promises delays unexpected surprises that ended up costing us more than the contractor s initial estimates changes to the original plans that also ended up boosting the price and so on it was a long series of one annoyance after another that we tried hard to frame as useful life lessons in general the contractor didn t display much interest in installing plumbing heating or renovating the bathroom one pleasant surprise however had to do with the construction of the new sauna one evening the contractor asked me to join him in the basement look at this he said with immense pride we cut the wood for the walls and the benches this way he showed me the fine grain of the wood cut how the screws were elegantly bolted below the surface of the wood the joining of the seams and so on i had to confess that although i had been irritated with him on many other levels he created a wonderful sauna in that project was evidence that he had a tremendous eye for detail his unusual level of artisan s pride made me wonder about the joy he felt in creating a completely new standalone and beautiful thing it seemed that from his perspective all the other aspects of the renovation were just fix it jobs to be done and only incremental improvements there was little that was creative or new about them moreover any level of renovation was not even close to transforming the old thing into a perfect thing the new windows sat in the old frames the new heating system couldn t fit precisely in the old house the renovated bathroom still maintained some of the old elements including the uneven floor which meant that the contractor could never feel that this was his bathroom his creation and without this feeling there was nothing in these everyday upgrades to encourage his best workmanship but the contractor s gorgeous sauna was a complete objet d art that he had taken a great deal of care to create from scratch i suspect that for him it stood as a tribute to his craftsmanship and creativity and was much more valuable in his own eyes than all the other work he had done 10 kids and ideas this attachment to one s own custom creation extends not only to physical things but also to ideas this attachment begins surprisingly early in an interesting set of experiments by vivian li alex shaw and kristina olson 11 four year olds were presented with two identical sets of craft materials five paper shapes and two cotton balls that could be glued together to make a design on a piece of construction paper the experimenters told the children to think of an idea for a picture they could create using these materials and then to tell the experimenter exactly how to put all the pieces together next the children and the experimenter switched roles the experimenter would think of an idea and tell the child where exactly to place the shapes the children could pick their favorite picture and take it home which do you think that the kids preferred the one that was the result of their idea or the one that was the result of their physical labor if you at your current age were deciding which one would you prefer by a pretty wide margin the children picked the picture that was the outcome of their own idea not the one where they provided the physical labor in another experiment this time involving five year olds researchers asked each child to dream up a story for example make up a story about a dragon and a little boy after the child invented the story another adult entered the room and the experimenter repeated the child s story by saying tommy just told me the best story in the no credit condition the experimenter told the other adult i have the best story in this case the children vociferously objected saying that was my story 12 what all of this means is that by a very young age we already care about our ideas and are attached to them the importance of identity now here is the question if a simple task like making a bionicle creature or circling letter pairs on a page can become more appealing by simply adding someone else s acknowledgment and if people love their horrible origami creatures even more when they put more effort into them how much more are we motivated to care about projects when we have truly invested all our heart mind and soul into them as the seattle engineers had done to think about this question consider the greatest customization project of all raising our own kids sumi and i are the parents of two incredibly adorable intelligent beautiful and talented children if we do say so ourselves whom we love more than we ever imagined possible like all doting parents we have spent endless sleepless nights and seen many a sunrise from the wrong side of the morning we have changed our kids diapers succored them through sickness dealt with their temper tantrums splashed with them in rivers and oceans put them to bed fed them driven them to school helped them with homework attended their soccer games school performances and countless birthday parties placed band aids on their skinned knees and put money into their college funds these labors of parenting are often challenging and sometimes unpleasant but we are motivated to do them because of our enormous personal investment in our kids when we look into their eyes and hear their laughter we see purer and more adorable versions of ourselves in short we re heavily invested in our children in all kinds of ways emotionally financially and with a deep sense of legacy that inherently extends beyond our life spans with this in mind let s think for a few moments about kids within the context of the origami experiment say you are a parent who like us is highly invested in your own two incredibly adorable intelligent and talented children for the sake of argument let s say you find yourself in some kind of the twilight zone style science fiction world where you take them to a park one day in this parallel universe another person plays with them for a few hours is enchanted with them and asks you with all middle class american earnestness are your kids for sale she promises that they will have a good home and will be well cared for what purchase price would you quote her in this alternate universe most people would state a very very high price unless of course the kids in question are teenagers but what if the situation were slightly different what if you did not have any children and you went to the park and met two wonderful kids who were very much like the ones you have in reality you play with them for a few hours as evening approaches and you get ready to say good bye the mother of the two children sidles up to you and says wow you have such a good connection with those kids they are for sale are you interested how much would you offer her my guess is not much this small thought experiment suggests that we think about our children as priceless not just because we love them so much but because they are also ours raising kids is pretty much a diy job we put enormous amounts of effort into them investing far more than a software engineer working for two years on a big project the process is time consuming and complex even if there were an instruction manual it would doubtless be much less accurate than anything from ikea and even if it were clearly written it would take a few lifetimes to read and understand the enormous effort we pour into our children also gives us meaning and connection and it makes us think about them as the unique creatures they are certainly it takes a lot of time and energy to play with them help them with their homework and the rest just as it does to create a beautiful home or a beautiful piece of work but the work itself rewards us and we remember it with much affection later in our lives thinking of our kids in this way can help us better understand the value that people place on their simple bionicle creations or the value that sumi and i projected onto our cambridge house we become more invested as we pour effort into different activities and with it experience greater love for what we have created our creations become part of ourselves and our identities as an added bonus we are all also largely blinded by our egocentric bias we just don t seem to recognize that the love for the outcome of our own efforts is limited to us alone the same basic lessons of meaningful engagement and our underappreciation for its role in our lives also apply to many other aspects of our lives which is why we often end up shying away from the more effortful and challenging experiences if we have the money we hire people to clean our houses take care of our yards or set up our wi fi systems to avoid being bothered by these common annoyances but think about the long term joy we miss out on when we don t engage in such tasks could it be that when we trade off annoyance for more efficient task completion that we end up accomplishing more but at the cost of becoming more alienated from our work the food we eat our gardens our homes and even our social lives the lesson here is that a little sweat equity pays us back in meaning and that is a high return 3 money is from mars pizza is from venus and compliments are from jupiter why money matters far less than we think a man with glinting chestnut brown hair stalks back and forth in a dingy office a storm rages outside the windows he eyes the men sitting before him with an aggressive indifference he informs the team of humiliated real estate salesmen that they re in for a few hard weeks at the office yelling in their faces like the world s most evil boot camp sergeant he also tells them that there s a contest to see who can close the most sales the first prize is a cadillac el dorado he tells them the second prize is a set of steak knives the third prize you re fired this infamous insulting motivational speech delivered by a young alec baldwin in the movie glengarry glen ross is an obscenity studded caricature of the business world s cruelty this scene with its abc always be closing directive is often listed as a must watch for management trainees reflecting the strong persistent and mistaken belief that external motivations such as threats are crucial ingredients in the recipe for inspiring hard work movies aside this type of cattle prod threat is unlikely to fly in the modern workplace but what about positive incentives such as annual and spot bonuses promotions titles company retreats health and retirement benefits which types of positive motivators inspire more dedicated work should management offer free coffee only to the employees who close deals should companies give more vacation time or better health benefits to those who achieve their quarterly goals should they assign nicer offices to the employees who more frequently stay at work after hours all of these questions point to a broader one which is what kinds of external rewards are best at positively motivating people because motivation is a part of almost everything we do and because it influences and sustains virtually every aspect of our lives it is impossible to come up with one simple set of motivational rules we could consider the general question by imagining motivating the people of a war ravaged nation the united nations or an nba team the directives would be quite different for each group let s start small and imagine that you are the ceo of a tiny startup company until now your company has had only one amazing employee you now you are ready to hire your next task is to set up the principles rules and regulations for how this company will treat future employees there is no workplace for dummies book from which you can learn exactly how to structure your firm s approach to its workforce instead you have to figure out the best way to train manage and retain your staff you need to create the company s hierarchy from the person at the top down to the newest hire you must set up a payment system will you pay people by the hour by the job by total output by the number of days in which no one makes any mistakes and what about health care benefits and bonuses daily weekly monthly yearly what should your sick and vacation policies be what is the right mix of intangible praise camaraderie and tangible salary bonuses gifts benefits that will encourage people to give their best rational regulation as if setting up the motivational forces at work is not sufficiently complex consider the even more complex task of policymakers when policymakers set up regulations they are trying to create sets of motivations that combined compel us to behave the way they want us to behave for example consider massive regulations such as the no child left behind now defunct or the affordable care act these complex policies use a mix of incentives that range from financial rewards to penalties from prohibitions and restrictions to public pride and shaming also known as accountability all of these positive and negative incentives are designed to spur specific intended behaviors and fix the problems in education and health care of course in practice these policies have not repaired education or health care and some argue that they have made things worse i suspect that many of their shortcomings stem from a mistake on the part of policymakers they did not start by examining the nuanced motivations of teachers and medical professionals most likely they did not ask themselves where do these professionals excel already where don t they need any additional motivation where do they struggle and need an extra boost which types of additional motivations would work best instead of asking specific questions about motivation policymakers most commonly conceive of policies as a big hammer and see teachers and medical professionals as a uniform set of nails they apply the simple payment for performance rat in a maze understanding of work as an exchange of money and labor which as we ll see often misses the point an experiment at intel because the problem of determining the best way to motivate people is so vast and context dependent there isn t nor will there ever be one experiment that would give us the one true answer to this question researchers can take only small steps in hopes of discovering how managers and policymakers can make slightly less damaging mistakes in their attempts to motivate people quite a few years ago uri gneezy a professor at the university of san diego california george loewenstein a professor at carnegie mellon university nina mazar a professor at the university of toronto and i carried out some lab experiments on the effectiveness of large bonuses 13 one of our main findings was that when the bonus size became very large performance decreased dramatically this counterintuitive effect stemmed from the stress and fear of possibly not getting the bonus but that was a lab result and since the laboratory environment is inherently limited in its ability to capture the true complex nature of labor we ve spent years searching for ways to experiment with real employees at their workplaces we wanted to study bonuses because almost all companies use some type of bonus yet despite their ubiquity and the fact that compensation is most businesses largest expense little is known about how effective bonuses really are even less is understood about what forms of payment work best so understanding the effects of bonuses became our white whale when looking for a promising testing ground for experiments on motivation and performance we thought about the types of jobs that would be best and worst to study defining the best jobs to study is complex but we can probably agree that one of the worst types of job anyone could consider for this purpose is something like mine since i m a university professor my productivity is hard to quantify does my employer measure my output by the number of papers i publish the number of talks i give the hours of teaching i put in the number of good ideas i have it s also difficult to measure the quality of my work for example is this book any good and by whose standards nor is the link between motivation and output direct or clear sometimes i might be highly motivated to find a particular answer to a question but the concept i am working on is not the right one sometimes i might not be terribly motivated but i stumble on a good research topic the challenges with measuring my productivity are not unique to professors in fact they are common to most knowledge workers your productivity is likely to be as complex if not more so than mine to measure to test the effectiveness of different motivations we needed to study a work environment in which employee output could be easily and accurately measured and where the tasks were more or less constant i lucked out when guy hochman then a duke postdoctoral fellow introduced me to liad bareket who worked in the hr department at intel in israel liad was interested in applying principles from social science to human motivation together with her team we designed and implemented an experiment at their semiconductor production facility this was exciting because we would get performance data for real working people laboring at a task assembling computer chips that was both easily and accurately measurable at this semiconductor factory the standard work cycle lasted eight days each workweek was composed of four days of twelve hour shifts followed by four days off the factory managers set up a bonus structure to help motivate the chip makers particularly on the first day of the work cycle the managers presumed that after four days off the chip makers needed an extra boost to get their productivity mojo back their version of a bonus worked like this every morning the manager informed the employees of their personal production target for the day but on the first day of the work cycle the manager also told them that if they reached that day s target they would receive a cash bonus of 100 nis about 30 at the end of their shift we thought that this structure was interesting but we wanted to see how this approach stacked up against no bonus at all usually when we propose testing whether a company s existing approach truly produces the outcome its leaders expect we don t encounter much enthusiasm but in this case the intel managers embraced the idea this was encouraging so we asked for another experimental condition what if rather than giving some employees a financial reward we promised to deliver a delicious family sized pizza to their homes this way we argued we not only would give them a gift but we would also make them heroes in the eyes of their families the nice people at intel liked the pizza idea but the logistics turned out to be too complex for the hr folks in the end we had to compromise on a voucher for pizza the voucher was not as wonderful as the pizza itself for the obvious reason that a piece of paper doesn t smell like mouthwatering garlicky sauce cheese and freshly baked crust and because the thought of eating a pizza tonight is much more immediately gratifying than a piece of paper representing a pizza in the future but the voucher was sufficiently different from the 30 bonus that it was worth testing we did not stop there next we asked for another condition what if some people weren t offered a tangible reward at all but instead received a text message from their boss saying well done for the first time in my let s try these ideas history the people in charge of compensation immediately agreed so in total we had four different conditions monetary bonus on the first day of the work cycle employees in this condition were greeted by the following message from their boss good morning if you reach or exceed x chips today you ll receive 100 nis in cash good luck pizza voucher this time the boss wrote good morning if you reach or exceed x chips today you ll receive a voucher for pizza good luck compliment in this condition workers were greeted by a message that informed them that if they reached or exceeded their production target they would get a text message from their boss telling them well done control in this case chip makers received no note and were offered no bonus what really motivates us before i reveal the results please pause for a moment and make a prediction do you think the tangible bonuses money and pizza improved the workers performances over receiving nothing and if so which one of the two do you think inspired the highest level of performance or was it the simple well done that unleashed the highest level of motivation or was that message the worst because it reminded employees that they were being asked to work for a kind word instead of a real bonus when i later asked a group of hr managers to predict the level of performance on the first day of the work cycle they guessed that the cash would be the most motivating followed by the pizza voucher they thought the compliment would come in third place and the control condition dead last consistent with the intuitions of these hr managers we indeed found that the cash pizza and a compliment all did better than the control condition all three approaches increased motivation to a similar degree but here was the surprise the pizza voucher boosted productivity by 6 7 percent almost identical to the 6 6 percent boost from the verbal reward of the three incentives cash performed the worst coming in slightly behind at 4 9 percent the results from the first day of the work cycle were clear any incentive is better than no incentive and the types of incentives we used money pizza and a compliment weren t very different from one another but this analysis focused only on the first day of the work cycle what about the next three days of the work cycle would there be a residual effect of the bonus on performance this is where things got more interesting on the second day of the work cycle those in the money condition performed 13 2 percent worse than those in the control condition it was as if they were saying to themselves yesterday they paid me a bit extra so i worked harder but today they aren t offering me anything special so i don t care on the third day the news was slightly less bleak those in the money condition dropped their performance by only 6 2 percent relative to the control condition by the fourth day productivity had drifted back toward the baseline with only a small decrease compared with the control condition 2 9 percent overall for the week the monetary bonus condition resulted in a higher pay the bonus and a 6 5 percent drop in performance compared with no incentive at all what about the compliment and pizza conditions as we mentioned earlier performance in the compliment condition rose 6 6 percent on the first day of the work cycle from there it slowly drifted down toward the control condition over the next three days and the pizza condition it fell somewhere in the middle between the monetary bonus condition and the compliment condition i suspect that if we offered a real pizza with a crispy crust and the smell of baked dough and melted cheese we would have seen an effect similar to that of the compliment condition perhaps with an even higher performance and if a representative from intel were to deliver the pizza personally the employees would have probably been extra delighted on the other hand if intel framed the pizza voucher in a more transactional way for example by mentioning its cost its motivational power would have been more like the monetary bonus condition hey boss what about your bonus with these surprising results in mind we told the top management at intel about our findings look we said you thought that the monetary bonus would boost performance but the data show that performance actually declined you ended up paying a bonus and getting worse performance clearly your intuitions about bonuses are not exactly on target why not let us test the effect of monetary bonuses throughout the company including the bonuses for top management as you might have guessed the executives had no interest in this research path overlooking intrinsic motivation one important lesson from our experiments at intel is that different types of motivations don t add up in a simple way in particular adding money to the equation can backfire and make people less driven we often assume people work for pay and that more compensation will translate into greater output furthermore i suspect that we hold this belief to an even larger extent when it comes to professions requiring significant physical labor and repetitive performance with few demands for creativity but at the semiconductor factory which largely involved physical labor this was clearly not the case instead we saw that monetary bonuses resulted in the sharpest decrease in productivity while rewarding people s performance with a compliment increased engagement even on the days when there was no bonus these results suggest that there is a lot more to work than merely the opportunity to earn money in exchange for labor if you think broadly about these findings it seems that we don t experience our work in day to day transactional terms we don t measure our lives out in coffee spoons as t s eliot wrote even in the most quotidian work instead we think and behave on a longer time scale which means that managers need to take into account and measure not only the direct effect of different incentives but also their delayed and enduring outcomes the more a company can offer employees opportunities for meaning and connection the harder those employees are likely to work and the more enduring their loyalty is likely to be given that we have all been involved in many different types of tasks throughout our lifetimes why can t we accurately understand and predict the effects of money on motivation are we that blind to our own experiences in a fascinating set of studies kaitlin woolley and ayelet fishbach both at the university of chicago measured the importance of intrinsic factors the degree to which we are engaged in a task for its pure enjoyment and the importance of extrinsic factors how much we get paid 14 kaitlin and ayelet conducted a variety of experiments at a gym to compare two types of motivations intrinsic motivation linked to the experience itself such as having a heart pumping stress relieving workout and extrinsic motivation linked to the outcome of finishing a task such as improved health from working out they found that when people were engaging in an activity such as exercising they cared most about intrinsic elements such as having a positive experience running on a treadmill or lifting weights on the other hand the researchers found that when people were planning to go to the gym they cared most about extrinsic elements such as finishing the activity getting healthier and getting paid for their time in short these findings suggest that when we are in the midst of a task we focus on the inherent joy of the task but when we think about the same task in advance we overfocus on the extrinsic motivators such as payment and bonuses this is why we are not good predictors of what will motivate us and what will crush our motivation this inability to intuit what will make us happy at work is sad if you are a new college graduate considering your options you might go for the high paying job at a bank instead of pursuing your dream career as a jazz musician certainly you will be able to afford more stuff and a nicer apartment if you take the bank job but as you mull over these two options are you overestimating the extrinsic motivators and underestimating the intrinsic joy of work don t offer money to mom motivation can also be deeply influenced both positively and negatively by social norms the cash bonus in our experiment at the semiconductor factory reflected market norms a direct exchange of money for labor leaving little room for caring and goodwill the verbal well done followed the lines of social norms which are essentially about gratitude reciprocity and the long term relationship between employee and employer in the middle was the voucher which operated more like a gift it had some recognizable value but it also conveyed some social ties and thoughtfulness in my book predictably irrational i gave the following example to illustrate how money can have a negative effect on social norms and apologies in advance to those of you who have already heard this one and remember it15 you are at your mother in law s house for thanksgiving dinner and what a sumptuous spread she has put on the table for you the turkey is roasted to a golden brown the stuffing is homemade and exactly the way you like it your kids are delighted the sweet potatoes are crowned with marshmallows and your wife is flattered that your in laws chose her favorite recipe for pumpkin pie for dessert the festivities continue into the late afternoon you loosen your belt and sip a glass of wine gazing fondly across the table at your mother in law you rise to your feet and pull out your wallet mom for all the love you ve put into this how much do i owe you you say sincerely as silence descends on the gathering you wave a handful of bills do you think three hundred dollars will do it no wait i should give you four hundred this is not a picture that norman rockwell would have painted a glass of wine falls over your mother in law stands up red faced your sister in law shoots you an angry look and your niece bursts into tears next year s thanksgiving celebration it seems may be a frozen dinner in front of the television set this example illustrates that when we are motivated by social considerations adding money to the mix can decrease the overall motivation and goodwill take dating for example a guy takes a girl out for dinner a movie and drinks and he pays the bills as they walk to her apartment he thinks about his chances of getting a passionate good night kiss and just before leaning to kiss her he casually mentions how much this evening has cost him how likely is it that the evening will end well for him there are some experiments that we don t need to run in order to know the outcome and this is likely one the moment we add money as a motivator in romantic relationships only bad things can come of it the power of relationships in the complex motivation equation it s also important to realize that work is not zero sum let s say i run a widget factory and you work for me each widget costs 3 for every unit you make i pay you 1 and the business gets 2 of which i receive a big percentage as the owner and ceo the more widgets you make the more 1 bills you are paid and the more money you and i especially i make of course if i pay you less let s say 25 cents i get even more money this is how we usually think about the workplace the metaphorical pie i e our share of dollars is assumed to be fixed and as a result there is a deep conflict between business owners and workers because when one makes more the others make less we have the opposite metaphor when it comes to social relationships when we re not at work we don t consider most relationships to be in the fixed pie category instead most of our relationships fall into an expanding pie category we don t assume that if we receive more love from our parents our spouse or our kids that we will give less of it in return in fact if we invest little love in a relationship the bond will be fragile and we won t derive very much from it but if we invest fully we experience a stronger relationship in the motivation equation love in its various forms builds upon itself when partners are in a successful relationship each strengthens the other and everyone in their circle benefits applying this pie expanding mind set to the workplace implies that instead of relying only on money as an incentive we need to expand our scope and examine other motivational forces ones that provide a greater sense of meaning and connection to work as people feel connected challenged and engaged as they feel more trusted and autonomous and as they get more recognition for their efforts the total amount of motivation joy and output for everyone grows much larger importantly it is not that hard to create the conditions for pie expansion even doing something as small as lightening the collective mood can build motivation at work in a lovely study sigal barsad divided her students into many small groups and had each group play roles in an imaginary salary committee that had to determine how to balance a limited share of the company s funds against getting the most from their employees 16 unbeknownst to the students sigal asked an actor a confederate to join the committee as well the confederate played his role in one of four different moods in some cases he displayed cheerful enthusiasm in others he radiated serene warmth in yet other cases he showed hostile irritability and for the final type of performance he portrayed depressed sluggishness the results showed that the actor s mood made a difference in all kinds of ways the groups in which the confederate was cheerfully enthusiastic or serenely warm displayed more cooperation and less interpersonal conflict performed better on their main task and distributed raises more fairly than the groups in which the actor displayed negative emotions and while the behavior of the acting student influenced the behavior of the group this was again a case where intuitions fail when researchers asked the students why they thought that their groups performed as they did the students did not point to the group dynamic as an important factor they had no appreciation of the magnitude of the difference that positive social forces can play and how miserable we can become when we get exposed to negative social forces the larger lesson here is that we can help our friends our coworkers our employees and ourselves when we remember that love and caring matter the joy of long term relationships how long does human connection have to last to deliver its boost to motivation imagine you wake up next to your significant other in the morning feeling the glow of love as you stretch you say so my darling do you want to renew our relationship vows for another day your significant other says sure and then you both get up shower go to work come home to dinner go to bed make love and wake up the following morning then you ask the same question again if you lived in this sort of day by day romantic life what would your mutual investment in your relationship be like most likely not that much when we decide to marry someone for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health we re committing not for the day week month or year but for as long you both shall live or at least as long as possible or let s say you procure a nice apartment in midtown manhattan overlooking central park you wake up in the morning with the sun streaming through the window pour yourself a steaming cup of coffee and ask yourself do i want to stay in this beautiful apartment another day in such circumstances you would hardly bother painting the bathroom fixing a crack in the molding or investing money in furniture and plants you might as well live in a hotel the point is that good relationships aren t transactional our need for connectedness anchors them on a longer time scale you won t bother putting a lot of energy into a short term relationship whether with a romantic partner employer colleague or apartment but if you think of that relationship as a long term investment then you will be motivated to deposit more of your love trust energy and time this sense of investment is the basis of the marriage vow and it is the basis of true dedication and loyalty in the workplace in the world of workplaces the relationship between universities and professors is as good as it gets universities on their side give professors tenure and with this lifetime commitment professors look at the university with deep trust and a long term view how can businesses that don t have lifelong tenure systems give commitment to and get commitment from their employees there are a lot of things that we can do to communicate a sense of long term commitment we can invest in employees education provide them with health benefits that clearly communicate a commitment to a joint healthy future invest in their well being both within and outside of work invest in their personal growth and provide them with a path for promotion and development within the company these kinds of actions don t guarantee long term employment in the same way that marriage does not guarantee that you will stay together until death do you part but they certainly change the time frame of the commitment to a longer one from marx to smith and back one of the early thinkers about the meaning of labor in the modern world was karl marx in 1844 marx wrote about what he called the alienation of labor which described a situation in which someone works on a small sub task in a small part of a larger enterprise like the worker in adam smith s pin factory the laborer has no idea what his project is all about he doesn t understand how his work fits in with the enterprise as a whole it is unclear to him who will use the product he makes and he generally feels no connection to the organization the project the end user or the outcome it is clear that adam smith and karl marx had very different understandings of the nature of productivity smith assumed that management could change the structure of the workplace and achieve more efficiency without sacrificing human motivation marx on the other hand assumed that the efficiency gained from breaking tasks into components would come at the expense of human motivation which perspective is correct as is often the case in deep philosophical debates each was correct on some level obviously there are all kinds of efficiency gains to be had by breaking tasks into components at the same time as our research has shown getting people to care deeply about their jobs by adding meaning personal investment and connection can create substantial benefits for both employees and employers work quality morale and productivity all improve while both perspectives contain important truths i believe that in an increasingly knowledge based economy it s becoming increasingly important to design organizations along marx s point of view in the knowledge economy the workplace relies heavily on trust engagement and goodwill and as the autonomy of each person in the organization increases so does the importance of making everyone feel deeply connected to the enterprise reflecting on my relationship with duke university i think of myself as someone who benefits from a win win relationship my work as a university professor and researcher is my job but it is also my hobby and to a large degree my identity and my life aside from the few moments when i sneeze and when i have an orgasm i am constantly thinking about human nature i think about what we know and don t know about ourselves about how to make things better and about new and more interesting experiments that might shine some light on human behavior i love this life and it is hard for me to think about what i would do if i stopped being a professor the benefits to my employer are clear duke gets a highly dedicated employee who is motivated to advance the university s mission and the benefits to me are clear i love going to work i love working with my students and collaborators i take great pride in our research findings and i get extra delight when our insights are applied in the real world but perhaps most important i feel that the work i do can have some long lasting impact on how we go about our lives i m not a marxist by political and definitional standards but i will say this when people are not able to focus on the larger meaning of their labor they are more or less stuck in the modern equivalent of a pin factory granted developing a workplace that is centered on meaning is not easy it is certainly more complex than the current efficiency based model of breaking tasks into components departments job specialties and sub organizations but in an era in which knowledge work is prized and creativity arguably matters far more than efficiency marx s view on alienation connection and control should be baked more directly into the dna of modern organizations to me the lesson from our research on motivation seems very clear as we become meaningfully engaged with our work we become both happier and more productive a win win situation if there ever was one the value of goodwill imagine that all jobs could be characterized along two dimensions the countable dimension comprises that which is concrete well defined and easily measurable number of pins made chips created gadgets sold and so on while the uncountable dimension is somewhat ill defined and difficult to measure improving a process helping others thinking brilliant thoughts etc of course some jobs are more countable than others when organizations attempt to create their compensation schemes the first mistake they often make as followers of the pin factory doctrine is to overemphasize the countable dimension following the principle of looking for your keys under the street lamp managers are drawn to the subset of tasks that are easily measurable as a consequence they overemphasize those parts of the job and divert attention and effort away from the uncountable dimension the second mistake managers often make is to treat the uncountable dimension as if it were easily countable in fact reducing labor to something simplistic and countable often misses the heart of motivation altogether how many times are employees judged on the number of reports they have written rather than on the quality of the work in the reports themselves here s another case in point before i became a professor at duke university i taught at mit the teaching requirement at this amazing institution was based on a point system professors were supposed to teach 112 points which we earned through a combination of time in the classroom the number of students we taught the number of hours the students worked the overall class load and so on as it turned out it was fairly easy to game the system and focus on research in fact i was so good at this that i managed to teach one large class a year composed of twelve three hour sessions yes thirty six hours of classroom teaching a year the sad point is that i enjoy teaching and some students enjoyed my classes the problem was that the measurement system directed me to work my hardest to try to minimize teaching time and compelled me to figure out how i could teach as little as possible in setting up the point system this way the designers of this incentive system no doubt having nothing but good intentions chase away the most important ingredients of the uncountable dimension basic trust and goodwill from the earliest stages of development we learn that we can earn trust and goodwill by extending the same thing to our parents and others if we smile they smile if we offer them some of our soggy animal cookie they give us a crisper animal cookie as adults when we buy something on credit the creditor is extending goodwill to us and in return we pay the bill on time such reciprocity is the foundation of a well functioning society the exchange of trust and goodwill is an important and inherent part of human motivation if you try to reflect on the role of trust in your own life it should become apparent how many of our everyday interactions involve trust we trust that the people who work with us will not steal our stuff and will respect our privacy that the people working at the cafeteria will take care to make sure that the food we eat is healthy and not spoiled we trust that the babysitter we hire will take good care of our children we trust that the neighbor isn t going to steal our mail break into our house or kill the dog a society without trust isn t a society it s a collection of people who are continuously afraid of each other trust and goodwill also inspires us to step out of our standard job requirements in order to excel and innovate if you like cooking you can think of goodwill in culinary terms it s the extraordinary spice that makes an ordinary dish so special flavorful and meaningful if you stop and consider your job for a few minutes you will probably come up with many ways in which the exchange of trust and goodwill influences your desire to deliver real progress just think about all the times you stayed late at the office answered emails while on vacation helped a colleague on a project unrelated to your work or thought about work related questions on the weekend unfortunately there are many ways to kill trust and goodwill the simplest is to pay people directly for their performance imagine for example that you worked for me and i asked you to stay late three times over the next week to help complete a project ahead of deadline at the end of the week you will have not seen your family but will have come close to a caffeine overdose as an expression of my gratitude i present you with one of two rewards in option one i tell you how much your extra hard work meant to me i give you a warm and sincere hug and invite you and your family to dinner in option two i tell you that i have calculated your marginal contribution to the company s bottom line it totaled 27 800 and i tell you that i will give you a bonus of 5 percent of this amount 1 390 which scenario is more likely to maximize your goodwill toward the company and me not just on that day but moving forward which will inspire you to push extra hard to meet the next deadline as the compliment condition at intel and our other experiments on social norms show my thanks hug and our family dinner would make all the difference in your feelings of current and future engagement the bonus however would put a numerical value on something that wasn t countable to begin with your commitment and while you might appreciate the cash the next time i ask you to help me with a deadline you will most likely ask how much let s kill the lawyers17 speaking of ruining trust and goodwill let s take a look at legal contracts now in many cases contracts are absolutely necessary but the way they are created the language used and their terms can easily destroy trust and goodwill not long ago i spent some time with a big company that does a lot of business with various suppliers in the early days the woman who founded the company would meet with her suppliers and confirm agreements with a handshake then the company grew with that growth came lawyers and official contracts these lawyers tried to plan for all kinds of low probability events what if the suppliers produced things that triggered allergies caught on fire were found to be toxic or changed color in storage these potential events may have been reasonable topics of discussion but when the lawyers insisted on including them as explicit items in contracts they came across as accusations the implication appeared to be that the suppliers were both incompetent and uncaring of course it was the lawyers job to anticipate all kinds of unlikely events but these contracts also destroyed any goodwill after holding these discussion accusation sessions with their suppliers the old timers at the company told me their relationships had become poisoned if the company ever needed something beyond what was included in the original contract a quicker delivery time or a change in quantity for example suppliers took it as an opportunity to charge more the contracts were ironclad but what the company gained in legalese it lost in goodwill legal mangling of course is not limited to the workplace consider the story of a single female friend of mine i ll call her anne and her gay male next door neighbor rob anne and rob were both single in their late thirties and enjoying their lives in manhattan both had good jobs and ample resources but they each realized they wanted to have a child anne and rob came up with a simple ingenious plan that would let them maintain their mutual independence while also having a family they would have a child together using in vitro fertilization ivf they were good friends they enjoyed long walks and meals together and they visualized how their friendship would continue and grow stronger with a cute kid swinging in between them sharing a child while remaining independent would let them enjoy the best of both family and single life under this perfect arrangement anne and rob would each have custody for a few days a week and enjoy their own single lives on the other days they would each surrender sleep for a few days a week to care for the baby but they would be free otherwise they could have lovers of their choice but still enjoy the warmth and love of shared parenthood they lived next door to each other so the kid would have two loving homes in contrast to most couples who plan to stay together and are caught by surprise when things don t work out anne and rob would start their family as separated parents wouldn t it be much better anne asked me for the kid to have a healthy separation from the start instead of the high probability of a bitter divorce anne and rob wondered if the whole institution of marriage was passé they figured that one day when we are in a more enlightened era everyone will approach the family structure this way they were ready to start the ivf process when a friend suggested that they first see a family lawyer to ensure that their agreement was legally solid the lawyer asked anne and rob questions about their backgrounds their childhoods families current lives work hobbies and incomes next he presented them with a set of dilemmas that they might face as a family how would they resolve simple conflicts if for example days of custody needed to be changed at the last moment because of a sickness a date or a work trip working with the lawyer anne and rob tried to flesh out a contract to sort out these potentialities next the lawyer asked them to think about more complex conflicts what if they disagreed about what time the child should go to bed the amount of tv time or the importance of doing homework what if one wanted to send the kid to a private school and the other didn t want to or couldn t afford it what if one of them got a significant promotion at work or had to move to a new city or country would they be allowed to move would the other move as well under the lawyer s guidance anne and rob tried to figure out what they would do they debated these hypothetical cases with as much intensity and passion as if they were real they soon found themselves disagreeing strongly and resenting each other s stubbornness it became clear that they were not going to create a new ideal family instead they wound up hating each other they haven t spoken since the perspective on anne and rob s dilemma is very different when you think of the family as a single unified entity and not as a contractual agreement between separate individuals in a long term relationship in which people are committed to each other and not just to their child there is an implicit understanding that ties the individuals to common goals committed couples are willing to give up something now for benefits in the future i will slow down my career path for a few years to support yours and are willing to put their own preferences on the back burner for the benefit of the family unit as a whole i love this city but it is better for all of us if we move the basic lesson is that when we are committed and think long term we largely put aside our own agenda for the good of the family and when we do so wonderful things can occur nourishing goodwill it seems self evident that our family social and professional lives depend to a large degree on goodwill but while we usually recognize the importance of goodwill in our romantic and social relationships we don t seem to appreciate its role in the workplace to the same degree in fact we often take actions that erode or even crush goodwill at intel for example we saw how paying people bonuses in a shortsighted way killed their motivation instead of understanding the crucial importance of human connection companies create rules and lists of punishments but these approaches only work in the short term and only when we are able to specify all of the exact potential outcomes to foster goodwill at work companies need to make it a core value across the company one of the most gallant efforts to reinforce goodwill came from doug conant campbell soup company s former ceo who handwrote thank you notes to people whose acts of goodwill reached his ears or his inbox by the time he left the company he d written more than thirty thousand such notes 18 the net net is this it is relatively easy to create goodwill all we need is an encouraging word here and there a gift from time to time and a sincere look in the eyes but we also need to keep in mind that goodwill is fragile supporting it is easy but destroying it is even easier 4 on death relationships and meaning the crazy urge for symbolic immortality and how love conquers all xin zhui isn t much to look at now her skin sags her arms hands and legs are ridden with valleys of wrinkles her eyes are sunken her limbs are still flexible though she has a terrible back a disc in her spine is fused she has clogged coronary arteries as well as gallstones probably the result of having eaten too much high calorie fatty food yet despite all of her ailments and her astonishing age you can still see some vestiges of xin zhui s former beauty her hands and feet are well formed she still has the high cheekbones of her youth and tiny shell like ears her tongue sticks out between her lips which gives her a vaguely amused expression as if she is about to lick an ice cream cone she seems so alive there s that hair a full head of indigo and her toes still invite a pink polish pedicure what beauty secret is this lady hanging on to there is no question that xin zhui aka lady dai aka the botox babe of anthropologists is pretty good looking for a woman who is more than 2 100 years old when she was thirty xin zhui was most likely nothing less than spectacular she had wide set intelligent imperious almond shaped eyes full lips and beautiful coloring 19 as the perfect trophy wife of a marquis she led a life of bored luxury with everything available to her she had precious little to do so she soaked herself in every possible comfort gorgeous spoiled and gluttonous lady dai was her own ancient han dynasty version of marie antoinette or leona helmsley 20 aside from being pampered how else did lady dai spend her time apparently she spent it thinking about the wonderful afterlife she would have in her next big beautiful amply appointed house and her plan years in the making was carried out perfectly when she finally breathed her last evidently from heart disease at the then old age of fifty lady dai s servants doused her body in a mildly acidic reddish liquid of mysterious origin which anthropologists think might have been considered an elixir of immortality during her time they then swaddled her in twenty layers of bacteria suffocating silk and encased her in a small coffin which they placed inside another coffin and another one and another one like russian nesting dolls the final and huge exterior coffin was made of special wood brought from more than a thousand miles away she was discovered in 1971 centuries after her death entombed fifty feet below the earth in a chamber that held her huge sarcophagus she was buried under five tons of charcoal and earth which effectively vacuum sealed her tomb to some extent lady dai did achieve immortality because she is the best preserved mummy ever discovered according to the medical examiners all her organs including her brain were found to be intact including some of the red albeit dry type a blood in her veins buried with her was everything this gluttonous lady needed including beautiful lacquer dinnerware and thirty bamboo caskets of fruit soybeans swans dogs pheasants and pigs on which she loved to feast 21 it was a bounteous supply intended to last her another lifetime symbolic immortality and the need for meaning like lady dai people in power across the ages and cultures all over the globe have taken measures to go on living after death in ancient egypt for example royal tombs were elaborately designed and laden with provisions clothing furniture toiletries food and drinks for sustenance in the afterlife but the ancient custom of burying people with grave goods has never completely ahem died out in 1899 a man named reuben john smith had himself entombed sitting on a brand new leather chair with a checkerboard in his lap and the key to the tomb in his pocket in 2005 a manhattan lawyer named john jacobs was buried with his active cell phone so that his wife could call him 22 and when a california socialite named sandra ilene west died in 1977 she was interred dressed in a lace nightgown in her 1964 ferrari 23 the question of course is why do people bother spending money on fancy cars expensive cosmetics lavish food and wine while one is alive might seem wasteful but at least we get to enjoy them why bother burying ourselves in a ferrari or carrying an active cell phone into the grave what kinds of benefits might we possibly derive from these products when we re dead this kind of investment might make sense if you believe that any material goods left at the tomb will stay fresh and be perfectly useful when you wake from death but what about those who don t believe they will go on living to enjoy their lovely tangible possessions the non afterlife believers also hold on to the hope that something will live on after death their dna in the form of their children and or their accomplishments and contributions whether you believe in the literal kind of immortality or not it seems that we all feel a craving for some kind of afterlife that we will be remembered after we re gone even if all that remains of us is a lonely symbolic grave marker that attests to the fact that we were once a living breathing and beloved human being how deep is this need for symbolic immortality before you answer this question ask yourself how you would feel if everything you did throughout your life was erased from the face of the earth the moment you died what if you knew from the moment that you started understanding the world that everything you wrote created every memory of you and every thought that others had about you would simply disappear without a trace upon your death how would this knowledge influence your daily life would you wake up every morning feeling excited to go to work to create to take care of your family and so on i m just beginning to do some research on these questions but so far it seems clear that many of our motivations are based on a horizon longer than our lifetimes and that in its absence much of our motivation would be crushed naomi s will in our thinking about death our desire for meaning can morph into all kinds of urges strange beliefs emotions and motivations that at first seem to make no rational sense for example why should it matter so much what other people think about us after we re dead consider wills for example i once knew a wealthy aging widow with a heart problem let s call her naomi naomi had two sons her older fifty something son ben was a tall strong former semipro tennis player and upright citizen he had been a straight a student in college and had gone on to have an illustrious legal career and a beautiful happy family the younger son jake had been a lifelong rebel a jazz musician in his mid forties jake barely eked out a living and had never settled down naomi often asked jake why can t you be more like your brother the more she berated him made suggestions for improving himself and compared him to ben the angrier and more withdrawn jake became eventually he barely spoke to her now imagine naomi drawing up her will weighing what she wants to leave her sons does she leave most of her fortune to ben the good son with the lovely family does she divide it equally between the two of them does she leave most of it to jake the less than wonderful son in hopes that he feels grateful and perhaps turns his life around does she leave most of it to her favorite charity what would you do if you were naomi before you answer let s step back for a moment and think about wills if you wanted to experience a tangible benefit from giving away your fortune wouldn t you do it while you were still alive so that you could enjoy seeing firsthand the effects of your generosity maybe you could reconcile with your estranged son or enjoy the gratitude of both children or enjoy helping your favorite charity expand its impact after you re dead it will be much harder for you to enjoy any of the outcomes of your wonderful actions when you look at giving this way it becomes clear that waiting until you are no longer around to give your money is at its core pretty irrational after naomi died of a heart attack ben dutifully arranged a sumptuous funeral to which jake never bothered to show up insulting the entire extended family so how do you think naomi distributed her fortune in her will she bequeathed 25 000 and some sentimental items to ben she gave another 25 000 to her favorite charity she left the rest of her substantial fortune to jake noting that she regretted not having valued him enough during her lifetime she wanted to make up with him and for him to feel more loved and appreciated but she did it in a way that moved their relationship forward only after she died our strange postmortem predilections naomi s desire for an intangible postmortem reconciliation with jake may seem odd but her example is run of the mill compared to some other attempts at post death connections one such man solomon sandborn asked in his will that his skin be stripped from his corpse and made into two drums and that his friend warren simpson would play yankee doodle on these skin drums at bunker hill on the 17th of june every year in commemoration of the revolutionary war battle fought there a man named samuel bratt whose wife had no doubt badgered him about his smoking bequeathed her 333 000 under the condition that she smoke five cigars a day the german poet heinrich heine displayed similar feelings about his wife he left his estate to her on the condition that she remarry to ensure that there would be at least one man to regret my death 24 some people leave fortunes to their animals the ultra wealthy leona helmsley for example left nothing to two of her grandchildren but bequeathed 12 million to her maltese who had no idea how to spend it though the dog s caretaker undoubtedly took the dog out to fantastic restaurants it is hard to tell whether naomi samuel bratt heinrich heine leona helmsley and many others who have used their wills to control their loved ones after death believed in some kind of tangible afterlife reward or not but the choices they made while alive about their afterlives show how the prospect of death motivated them in all kinds of strange ways one way to understand post life motivations is by examining funerals because they symbolize a transition between life and death they provide a magnifying glass with which to examine the way we view and make decisions about the afterlife funerals in soweto and other poor communities in africa for example can cost a substantial amount of the family s yearly household income building up the deceased s reputation but destroying the wealth of the living relatives in the united states too spending on funerals is a common path to financial ruin one sad example is a story i recently heard about a couple both with serious health issues and no money when the wife passed away her husband who loved her so much borrowed money to pay for a nice casket and embalming so that her beautiful face could be viewed at the funeral a few hours later they cremated her body and a few months later the husband went bankrupt in our studies on funerals we found that grieving people don t consider money as much when planning funerals people are willing to spend more on the accoutrements of a funeral coffin flowers and service for a loved one than they would choose for themselves even though they realize that the loved one would have counseled them to spend their money more wisely and this overspending is not limited to people who have money to spare the point is that we the living are driven by a range of motivations including the way we want to think about the dead their role in our lives our role in their lives and the prospect of our own mortality from this perspective closely examining funerals gives us some interesting insights on the drive for literal and symbolic immortality and the kinds of motivations that influence us more generally including caring about others helping making amends and finding meaning observing funerals and the rituals around them makes it clear that we have a deep need for symbolic immortality at either a conscious or unconscious level we want to outlast our physical life and to be remembered through the things we leave behind us our children or our achievements this is why wealthy individuals start charitable foundations and put their names on buildings why starving artists draw and write why graffiti artists paint on underground walls why children carve their names in rocks and trees why michelangelo painted on the ceilings of chapels why athletes work so hard to break records and even why some people eat hundreds of hot dogs at a sitting just to get their names in the guinness world records our motivation to leave a legacy is powerful and interesting in its own right but maybe more than any other type of motivation it provides us a window into the complexity and multiplicity of the elements in our motivation equation an equation that we are just starting to uncover appreciate and understand epilogue the answer to the ultimate question the mystery of motivation in summary in the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy douglas adams describes the search for the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything to get this answer a specially built supercomputer called deep thought spent 7 5 million years toiling away here s the passage from the book good morning said deep thought at last er good morning o deep thought said loonquawl nervously do you have er that is an answer for you interrupted deep thought majestically yes i have the two men shivered with expectancy their waiting had not been in vain there really is one breathed phouchg there really is one confirmed deep thought to everything to the great question of life the universe and everything yes both of the men had been trained for this moment their lives had been a preparation for it they had been selected at birth as those who would witness the answer but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited children and you re ready to give it to us urged loonquawl i am now now said deep thought they both licked their dry lips though i don t think added deep thought that you re going to like it doesn t matter said phouchg we must know it now now inquired deep thought yes now all right said the computer and settled into silence again the two men fidgeted the tension was unbearable you re really not going to like it observed deep thought tell us all right said deep thought the answer to the great question yes of life the universe and everything said deep thought yes is said deep thought and paused yes is yes forty two said deep thought with infinite majesty and calm 25 as deep thought provided 42 as the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything it also pointed out that the answer is meaningless because it was never clear what the question was when asked to produce the ultimate question deep thought said that it could not however it could help to design an even more powerful computer that after running for ten million years would be able to provide the question in the story planet earth turns out to be this more powerful computer this same logic applies to the question of motivation it is such a general and large question that it encompasses almost every aspect of human endeavor and drive because the question of motivation is so complex exploring it is like being lost in the amazon jungle without a map we can t provide a single answer or perspective to motivation as a whole and even if we could doing so would probably take an infinitely long time after all philosophers psychologists crime novelists and many many others have struggled with the question of motivation and so far we have only fumbled our way toward 42 as we ve seen the story of motivation isn t at all straightforward rather it is intricate and mysterious in addition to our general appreciation for the complexity of human motivation what specific lessons have we learned among all of the motivating forces in the world it turns out that money isn t the simple great motivator most of us assume it to be in fact sometimes it is a disincentive we ve also learned that at some point or another we all become offenders against perhaps even killers of human motivation when we ignore criticize disregard or destroy the work of others we have also learned that we re much more driven by all kinds of intangible emotional forces the need to be recognized and to feel ownership to feel a sense of accomplishment to find the security of a long term commitment and a sense of shared purpose we want to feel as if our labor and lives matter in some way even after death to motivate ourselves and others successfully we need to provide a sense of connection and meaning remembering that meaning is not always synonymous with personal happiness arguably the most powerful motivator in the world is our connection to others i remember a teenager named sarah a patient for a short time in the burn unit of the hospital where i was treated after a breakup from her boyfriend sarah tried to commit suicide by slitting her wrists and rubbing ajax a toxic cleanser into the wounds when she was well enough to walk around she began to visit other patients on the ward patients who were in much worse shape with deeper and more extensive wounds she went from room to room offering us water telling us stories chatting with us and generally brightening the mood of that terrible place in seeing how lucky she was compared to the rest of us and how much we all appreciated her visits she quickly got out of her romantic melancholy during world war ii the great moral philosopher victor frankl discovered how a sense of connection to his beloved helped him survive a nazi death camp one night as he and fellow prisoners were being marched through a dark forest a fellow prisoner turned to him and whispered what if our wives could see us now frankl looked up at the stars and thought of his own beloved wife s face he heard the sound of her voice and felt her presence that presence gave him the strength to live even as people all around him died afterward he went on to give the world a rich legacy of work including man s search for meaning in which he included these words for the first time in my life i saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers the truth that love meaning and connection are the ultimate and highest goal to which man can aspire then i grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart the salvation of man is through love and in love 26 ultimately this book asks you whether you re an executive a parent a salesperson a teacher a government official or anyone else who seeks to motivate yourself or others to think deeply and broadly about the effects of your approach my hope is that by understanding some of the hidden forces of motivation we will find it easier to deploy the positive intangible drivers that affect us after all if a kind word can do wonders to impel people to do better what other hidden treasures of energy dedication and commitment might we find if we only looked for them in the realm of physics people have long dreamt of the possibility of getting something out of nothing in other words creating the perpetual motion machine building a real perpetual motion machine is impossible since it would violate the laws of thermodynamics but when it comes to human motivation we can have perpetual energy as long as we invest in a sense of connection meaning ownership and long term thinking and if we correctly use these forces the return on investment in human motivation will be immense we are certainly far from grasping the full complexity of motivation but the journey to understand the thousands of strange and wonderful nuances beneath motivation with a capital m is going to be exciting interesting important and useful and if we do it right the journey will reveal the secrets of more productivity love and meaning now that s motivating ',\n",

like flame to maintain this ecstasy is success in life walter pater writer the idea for this book came blurting into my brain on a flight from pittsburgh to silicon valley my ninety nine belongings were in the mail my backpack was bloated with few clothes and many dreams and i had just finished rereading you shall know our velocity by dave eggers a frenzied novel in which the broken but satisfied hero drowns on the cover the book starts right on the cover flashes back three months and drags his best friend to senegal morocco and estonia in one week to give away all of his money and chase adventure i gave the cherished book to the woman sitting next to me who had heard of it and heard me laughing at the part where will tries to leap from a car to a donkey cart in marrakech i thought here s a guy who lived so much in one week that it overflowed a book s pages and he had to summarize the rest of his three month epic escapade in a sentence and die on the cover what had i done in the last three months wrote code for 717 hours got better at handstands and pull ups packed my moving box discovered that eating half a stick of butter a day wasn t good for my brain my adventure count was zero i felt a moment of panic as if i had let my protagonist license expire and now i would have to retake the test i had planned this ruthlessness of work so i could finish my

secondly to set a time limit how long does it take to write a book or train for a marathon i had no idea i d never written anything longer than an agonizing sixteen page school paper or run further

skateboarding and knife throwing or because they d be useful and fun like learning 3 000 new chinese words and reading twenty books the rest i had to do like giving the two best man speeches and running the startup i wanted to make sure i did them well for each goal i decided on success criteria and motivation hacks to fire me up i ll introduce these motivation hacks throughout the book and they re also listed in chapters 11 and 12 i estimated how long each mission would take built a schedule that could just barely fit if i wasted no time and grinned at myself in challenge let s see what you ve got nick techniques a chef wields dozens of tools from spatulas to potato scrubbing gloves every once in a while he ll need the pastry brush but every day he ll use a chef s knife a frying pan salt and a stove like a chef a motivation hacker has a core set of tools i ll introduce these in chapters 3 and 4 success spirals precommitment and burnt ships sometimes you can reach into your motivation pantry chapter 12 and pull out some timeboxing but it s often best not to get too fancy and just as the chef who dogmatically used his chef s knife for everything would cook a terrible pancake so would a motivation hacker fail to quit an internet addiction using only precommitment no single technique can solve every problem this book will recommend several approaches to increasing motivation use more than one at a time self help books i ve read some great self help books that inspired me in these books the author writes about how he used to suck at something how he epiphanied out and then worked towards a dream for years and how now he s amazing at everything and it s all because of this empirically validated pareto distilled 5 beautifully zen method which he has developed and wants to share with you in small bites mixed with inspirational anecdotes about how he applied the technique in his impossibly interesting life i would consume one of these books maybe create a to do to reorganize my to dos and go back to exactly what i was doing while feeling great about how great i would be someday i actually have no idea how many people read the 4 hour work week 6 and then start a business that gives them the freedom to sell their junk and travel as in life nomadic 7 then return to crush 8 being rich 9 while winning 10 things 11 and getting people done looking back i guess i did go on to take the advice in these books some of it eventually and i guess i m trying to write the same kind of book mixed 75 25 with the easy gobble one year stunt book 12 but if i try to make myself sound more successful than i am or falsely credit any accrued success to motivation hacks undeserving or tell you that doing what i ve done is hard while winking as if to say but you re just the person to succeed where most will fail if ever i try to feed you dreams as though they were meat then you shall call me out as a shameful braggart i wrote this book as a way of forcing myself to live excellently and to give good ideas on how to do the same to those who hunger who can t subsist on wishful thinking alone some of these motivation techniques seem like common sense but they are rarely applied i read about them added them to my routine and found them so effective that i wondered why everyone wasn t using them some won t work for you i write about ways to find your own path but i m a 26 year old american guy who works for himself has neither debt nor pets nor children runs barefoot and doesn t know two things about what s going on in the news today my perspective may be different enough that i forget things you may still need shoes to walk your own path motivation hacking motivation is fuel for life without motivation you can t get out of bed with just enough motivation can t be late again you eventually get out of bed but not before twenty muddled minutes of half dreamt schemes for skipping out today with a little extra suddenly it s not so bad breakfast but when you have sixty extra gallons of it you leap from bed as if it s christmas and you re pretty sure that the big box in the back is the new xbox more motivation doesn t just mean that we re more likely to succeed at a task but also that we ll have more fun doing it this is what we want this is why we hack motivation it s not as simple as hooking up xbox sized rewards to every boring task but it s easier than trying to accomplish anything without enough motivation hack like this first pick your goals then figure out which motivation hacks to use on the subtasks that lead to those goals and then use far more of them than you need so that you not only succeed but that you do so with excitement with joy with extra verve and a hunger for the next goal you can use motivation hacking to improve anything that takes time and effort and if you get good at it you might find yourself gleefully penning your opus in the morning bike touring nepal during the day rocking on guitar at night checking up on your steam powered skateboard business on the weekends and scaring the locals with your laughter at the thought of how you used to drown out thoughts of the dreadful five page paper with television shows about fascinating characters doing things only slightly more fantastic than what you re doing or maybe you ll just keep your house cleaner and learn a little russian i don t know what happens when contented people try supermotivation perhaps they re just happier doing the things they did anyway or perhaps ambition is a necessary catalyst for excitement but i used to have no ambitions and as i slowly fixed myself they appeared maybe there are no people without big dreams just people with their eyes shut some ask me about how i do what i do and when i tell them their eyes open wide that gives me hope for them and for this book stay with me and i ll tell you about the best motivation hacks i ve found i ll show you how i used them to fill a life that used to contain only work and before that only escape there will be funny stories to keep us both entertained and inspired i won t zazz it up life truly did rock during this project and although i include just the most interesting bits to read there was as much glory in hour two of writing each day as there was during that first rush of speed on the skateboard ready keep your eyes open and let s go chapter two how motivation works the motivation equation here is the motivation equation 13 i remember it as mevid motivation hacking is the process of figuring out what you want to be more excited about then coming up with strategies for manipulating the terms in this equation motivation is what you always want more of fire energy excitement it s that which drives you to act to achieve your goals expectancy is your confidence of success when you re sure you can win high expectancy motivation is high when you think you ll probably fail even if you try you won t try motivation is low value is both how rewarding a task will be when you finish it and how fun it is while you re doing it working on goals that are important to you brings high motivation doing boring pointless things causes low motivation impulsiveness can be thought of as distractibility how likely you are to put a task off and do something more pressing when you have other things you d much rather be doing your impulsiveness is high and your motivation low if there s nothing else you could be doing right now then impulsiveness is low and motivation high delay is how far off the reward seems to be this is often hard to manipulate directly rewards are often delayed so far that we hyperbolically discount 14 them into worthlessness but sometimes you can set yourself up to perceive delay differently thus scoring a big motivation win by increasing expectancy or value or decreasing impulsiveness or delay you hack motivation for an example of low motivation look to the typical graduate student trying to work on her dissertation her expectancy of success may be low since she knows that only 57 15 of grad students finish their phds in ten years and they probably didn t change their research focus three times already the value of the phd is uncertain since she s no longer sure she wants to angle for one of the few industrial research lab positions working on peer assisted tutoring systems and writing conference papers is even less fun than she s managed to trick herself into thinking her impulsiveness toward solo dissertation writing is off the charts since there s a whole department of other fascinating grad student friends also procrastinating on their work by doing exciting things to which she is repeatedly invited and with who knows how many years left before she could possibly finish the delay of her reward is about as long as that of walking the circumference of the planet every bit of work she completes toward her dissertation will be due either to an extreme expenditure of will a stern exhortation from her advisor or a clever motivation trick what about someone bursting with high motivation let s look at the same graduate student working on her side project a silly web game where players compete to bet whether absurd facts are true or false example blue whale aortas are wide enough for a human toddler to crawl through true or false 16 she came up with the idea with a couple friends hacked together a prototype one weekend when she couldn t bear to think about rerunning her latest study with more participants and has attracted a small community of enthusiastic players in response to demand she s adding new facts and working on a feature where players can submit their own facts and rank others submissions she explodes with motivation and is having a blast at the expense of her dissertation same person different motivational factors for her side project her expectancy is high since she knows she can easily improve what she has already done the value of building new features is high because it s fun and because her players and friends are congratulating her with each hilarious new fact she writes her impulsiveness is low because this is the project her friends are all inviting her to work on and the delay is low because every time she makes an improvement it goes out to her players right away now doing science may well be more important to her than making games she may learn the wrong lesson and think she s not cut out to do research because otherwise why would her revealed preferences be so out of whack it might be true that she doesn t like research in which case she should quit her phd and do something else like start a game company but it might also be true that if she just put some work into optimizing her motivation environment she could reignite the passion that brought her there in the first place she could use the techniques in this book to pursue either goal and she would likely succeed even if she picked the wrong one perhaps never realizing that she d found the lesser fulfillment motivation hackers are in danger of achieving the wrong goals in a few chapters after showing you the first three motivation techniques and giving some examples i ll return to this idea with some warnings about carefully choosing goals those risky investments of time look out example avalanche if you ve gotten the drift of the four motivation factors already then fly past this section otherwise see if any of these common low motivation situations apply to you expectancy high expectancy no matter the task you know in your core that you can learn to do it well so you look forward to any challenge low expectancy you want to lose weight but nothing has worked before so it s hard to maintain healthy choices you have never been very athletic so you avoid physical pursuits you view yourself as a poor student who can t get good grades you worry you ll never be able to find a great romantic partner you think it would be cool to write a book travel the world start a startup become a hero but you doubt you could pull it off public speaking dancing terrifies you you think you aren t good with money you can t drive ride a bike swim sing draw do math talk to girls understand computers cook be fashionable get good grades you don t think you can be happy all of these things can be done with a little practice by almost anyone when you have low expectancy though your confidence is so low that you aren t willing to practice you feel as if everyone else can just do these things without trying and you can never be good at them you ve learned to be helpless i learned to be helpless at 16 out of 23 of these classic low expectancy skills above once i fixed my general expectancy problem the only ones i still can t do are sing and draw and i just haven t gotten around to practicing those yet the biggest hack a motivation hacker can perform is to build her confidence to the size of a volcano an oversized eruption of expectancy can incinerate all obstacles in the path to any goal when you combine it with good planning value high value you spend most of your time doing things so fulfilling that whenever you stop and think about it you can t help but grin to yourself low value you don t enjoy much of your job you don t see the point of school it s hard to keep exercising because it s so painful or boring efforts to learn a foreign language always peter out cleaning your room is a chore you can rarely bring yourself to do you d rather watch tv read books surf the internet play games than work toward your goals you get burdened down and stressed out by a bunch of boring tasks you fall asleep at your desk you don t have a good answer to the question of what are you looking forward to when you see low value in what you re doing either because the end reward is not important or because the process is not enjoyable motivation is scarce it can be hard to tell whether something actually isn t valuable to you versus when your motivation is too low from other factors so it s easy to mistake a bad motivation environment for not caring and vice versa there are several tricks to make a boring process more exciting but much of value hacking lies in changing what you re doing from things that drain you to things that fill you up the motivation hacker learns to steer his life towards higher value and to have fun demolishing boring necessities in his way impulsiveness low impulsiveness at any time there s only one clear thing that you want to do so you have no problems focusing on it high impulsiveness you feel like checking your email facebook news frequently when you re trying to work you find yourself distracted by entertainment after work when you said you wanted to be creative or productive you have problems focusing on what you re doing instead daydreaming or chatting with friends you get the urge to snack when you re not hungry instead of starting or persevering in some task there are so many things you want to do that you can t concentrate on what you have to do it takes superhuman effort to focus on a task when you re surrounded by distractions but when you remove distractions in advance no such effort is required concentration flows the motivation hacker learns to anticipate and eliminate distractions and temptations making it trivial to follow through with her plans delay low delay you are always so close to achieving one goal or another that you never lack the urge to go finish something high delay whatever that paper is due in like two weeks it would take years before you d be good at guitar japanese art gymnastics writing so you don t want to practice junk food sure it s not going to kill you tomorrow or anything the thought of eight years of medical school prevents you from becoming a doctor it s hard to save up money for future purchases because they re so far off we humans are built to hyperbolically discount rewards based on how far in the future they are we all do it slightly differently as measured by experimental psychologists and economists a dollar today might seem worth sixty cents to me if i must wait until tomorrow whereas to you it might seem worth eighty cents but it s a huge bias for all of us there s no point in fighting it by thinking that rationally the value should be the almost the same now as it will be later that s not how our brains work and those brains will make decisions for us based on hyperbolically discounted values not rationally recited values pizza now work later train for olympics never the motivation hacker learns to structure goals so that the perceived delay is not so great intermediate milestones process based goals and willfully optimistic planning are his tools here with the right mindset success is ever right around the corner note on the research i first read about the motivation equation in a blog post 17 over a year ago in march 2011 the article summarized piers steels book the procrastination equation which was itself a summary of the state of our empirical evidence about how motivation works and techniques for improving it i started experimenting with the techniques listed 18 in the article some of which i found tremendously useful i then took the most powerful techniques i d found and pushed them far beyond their original focus of fixing procrastination while most of these techniques are backed up by science my recommendation of applying several of them at once to achieve superhuman motivation levels is beyond what has been studied this may mean we re back into the land of authorial anecdote but i think it s not a far leap from using enough motivation to accomplish a goal to using excess motivation to have a blast doing it i hope you will make this leap with me willpower there are several competing models of willpower the oldest model says willpower is an innate character trait and you re either a strong willed disciplined person bound for success or you re not if this model is correct then you would probably know whether you have a lot of willpower or not much if you do have a lot then you can rely on it to carry you through the hard parts on the way to your goals and if you don t then you d better pick out a smooth path to your goal from the onset or you ll fall off a more popular model of willpower is that it s like a muscle the more willpower you exert the less you ll have that day with which to resist further temptations but the more you ll have in the future as your will strengthens were this ego depletion 19 model true you d want to make sure you weren t going to need to use too much willpower at any given time leaving your will weak for when you d need it most you would avoid ben franklin ing out 20 by trying to do too much at once and instead aim for a modest exertion of will as you pursued your goals a third model of willpower is that willpower works like a muscle only if you believe it does 21 if you think that resisting a cookie will make you slack off later then you re more likely to eat the cookie in hopes of saving willpower for working later or to slack off if you ve already done well by resisting the cookie if you don t believe in willpower as an exhaustible resource then the cookie has no effect on slacking off in this case you don t generate the excuses which sap willpower some thinkers have suggested that willpower doesn t exist that all of human behavior is explainable without invoking special cognitive intervention to override our natural interests psychologist george ainslie s response to this is my favorite concept of will 22 the will is a recursive process that bets the expected value of your future self control against each of your successive temptations that is will is simply the process of making personal rules for ourselves that will help us reach our goals and how much willpower we can muster is precisely how good we are at setting up these personal rules so that the we always prefer to keep our rules than to break them this is a learnable skill regardless of what model of willpower the motivation hacker uses she will structure her goals so that she doesn t need to rely on willpower to achieve them if we can muster it willpower makes up for insufficient motivation by consciously imposing values on our decisions the motivation hacker plans to always have excess motivation if willpower comes into play if it s hard for her to resist a cookie or focus on work or wake up for a run then this is a sign that she needs to do more motivation hacking or goal adjustment until that discipline isn t needed willpower seems to be needed in one scenario when deciding to begin in order to commit to a goal you need to deny yourself room to weasel out instead you must design a sufficiently powerful motivational structure in advance for some reason this part is hard if you have ideas for how to make it easier let me know the one tip that i have is that if you can t bring yourself to commit to a goal now then try picking a date far enough in the future that it s not as scary and commit to starting then then in the meantime talk yourself into it you shouldn t overuse this tactic committing now is an important habit to build don t read the next chapter until you re ready to commit you don t get many chances with success spirals chapter three success spirals goals afford achieving motivation increases with expectancy confidence that you will win when you know you re going to succeed motivation abounds when you think you might not be able to accomplish a goal then motivation suffers fail once lose some confidence and motivation try less fail again and repeat until you ve no hope left it s easy to start sliding down into this hole you fall fast and once you re at the bottom it seems as if there s no light by which to start clawing back up to the surface soon you feel as if you were born in this darkness just bad at math don t know how to talk to girls can t manage money clumsy not a dancer a shy person at least your brain can cordon off these confidence pits so that you can be confident in sports or writing or telling jokes even as you ignore the muttering from those hapless pieces of yourself which took their first steps down instead of up and have never returned the converse is true too success begets confidence and motivation which begets more success and pretty soon you re fearless on wheels or look forward to crushing spelling tests to start as an adult after your identity is set and your limits clearer this is a fragile staircase and requires climbing but it can take you just as high as the pits are deep and quicker than you d think when you ve climbed high enough that you can t even see the ground when you ve accomplished goal after goal without fail then each new goal will be familiar even if it s harder than anything you ve ever done before and there will be no fear no doubt just confidence and with a little planning and a lot of motivation you can climb as high as you want once you ve climbed several success spirals you ll see those i can t pits as the challenges they are success spirals that just start a little lower you can get to the point where even the craziest goals afford only achievement and the question becomes not can i do this but do i want this the answer is then usually sure why not 23 how to do it to start building your success spirals first make a tiny achievable goal that you can t forget to do setting a reminder for yourself helps then track your success doing this goal eventually the tracking system you develop can be the reminder for goals in any arbitrary success spirals you re working on you don t have to shoot for 100 daily adherence but you should have a definite cutoff like 95 your goal also needs a completion date you can t succeed at doing something forever even if it s easy eventually life changes you can avoid candy for one month or keep the dishes clean for two months or meditate every day for two weeks but then the goal should be completed you can always re up your success spiral on that goal if you re still interested or make it harder or easier often though your interests will move on and you don t want to be stuck doing something of low value just to strengthen your expectancy the important part is to never weasel out of doing what you said you d do if the day comes where you can t do the goal do it anyway if it truly is impossible then your expectancy will take damage if it s just frustratingly inconvenient and hard that day then when you persevere your expectancy will grow and you ll learn to plan better next time try to anticipate any obstacles that could come up and then either make the goal easy enough that you d still be able to deal with them or include them as explicit excuses an intermediate success spiral might start with a goal defined like this i will run 57 out of the next 60 days even if it s just for two minutes although i ll aim to run for twenty minutes i will set a recurring reminder to run at 5 30pm i will place a run tracking notebook by my bed to mark whether i ran that day and to remind me to do it before bed if i still haven t if i become sick enough to call off work or if i am injured to the point where running would be unhealthy then i don t have to run a beginning success spiral might look very similar except with something easier than running like brushing one s teeth or reading books here is an example of an advanced success spiral goal which one should not attempt without building up to it no wheat or dairy for thirty days this one is hard yet it s recommended all the time as if it s a piece of cheesecake to accomplish you have to shoot for 100 adherence because the point of the avoiding these foods entirely is to flush them out to determine intolerance if you ve done many dietary restriction experiments before then you can probably do this one too but if you haven t then this is like trying to make money as an amateur gambler one lapse of your unpracticed judgment and you re done for my organization for success spirals is simple i keep recurring goals that i might forget in my to do software like journaling daily or measuring my bodyfat percentage every two weeks others i add to existing routines like doing handstands before bed or eating vitamins on waking others are habitual enough now that i don t remind myself at night before bed i open my google drive spreadsheet 24 and quickly record whether i have achieved each daily goal while also recording some useful self experimental data this habit ties all the success spirals together and also conveniently reminds me to do anything i ve forgotten at that moment where i would have to put a zero in its column otherwise now i can rely on myself to make progress on fifteen easy things and three hard things each day but it took a year to build my success spirals to this point where i started when i first set out to use success spirals the only thing i could reliably do was work i had put all other goals on hold for the sake of my startup skritter and in the evenings when i wasn t working i read hacker news 25 played smash brothers 26 with my cofounders george and scott and then worked some more anyway since i didn t know how to get myself to do anything else previous attempts at learning this or producing that had always petered out my brain had done its protective trick where it explained these failures as things that i would be able to succeed at later once i weren t so desperately burdened with the destiny of my startup and i made it to the gym on and off when george and scott were also going though i hated going and refused to admit it i didn t understand that the problem wasn t that i was that unhealthy geek who didn t want to become stronger but that my barely sufficient motivation made it unpleasant to go i then read about the motivation equation and the technique of success spirals and decided to try the idea of always accomplishing my goals excited by the idea of developing unshakable confidence in success on a broad spectrum of goals i decided to set a lot of tiny goals each of which i could do in a few minutes and which i decided i would do at least six days each week with an overall average of 95 adherence the most difficult and important part of starting a success spiral is starting small enough that it s trivial to succeed i probably started too ambitiously this was when we were running the startup from costa rica and i was preparing to move to pittsburgh afterwards and bursting with things to try here is what i set out to do skritter study chinese on skritter for at least one second write journal at least one word 27 on 750words 28 meaningful work do some skritter development not just email or discussion weight training do at least one strength exercise even if it s just an easy set of pushups no to dos older than 3 days make sure no miscellaneous tasks have remained undone longer than three days feedback limit check email and skritter forum no more than every 90 minutes surfing limit spend no more than 30 minutes per day on misc internet anki 29 do some spaced repetition learning system flashcard reviews social go out and be social at least 5 days a week the social goal of forcing myself to make new friends was the only hard one which was my main focus since i was most afraid of it then so i could track some more things without overloading my nascent success spiral i added some optional goals which i wanted to do 90 of the time eat vitamins so easy once the habit is there be friendly online communicate with one distant friend each day practice handstands do one minute a day and record my longest balance time be sweet to my girlfriend chloe make sure to demonstrate love in a way that she appreciates gaze into chloe s eyes i read that this is a good relationship hack and she has pretty eyes anyway update goals go through my google docs spreadsheet each night and mark my adherence to these goals mentally contrast 30 goals for each goal spend a little time thinking about where i am vs where i d like to be it worked i overshot my adherence target on all of my goals and turned them all into good habits in just a few weeks i had never had such success with building habits before the tip which worked for me was to focus on input based process goals write for five minutes rather than output based results goals write one page and to keep the required inputs minuscule at first do one minute of handstand practice was always easy enough and so after under six hours of total practice i got to a sixty second freestanding handstand some days the results sucked couldn t balance but it didn t discourage me or take extra time as it would have if i had needed to achieve a certain level of balance with each practice as my success spirals grew stronger i experimented with adding different goals and found most of them just as easy to habitualize in this way i didn t always do it right sometimes i added output based goals that required a huge effort to stay on top of other goals were more a matter of changing unconscious behaviors rather than putting in enough time i failed at adding the habit of photographing everything i ate since by the time i remembered to photograph something i d often already eaten it too late and the one original habit of clearing all to dos within three days was not entirely successful because sometimes i would put too much on my to do list and it just wasn t possible to finish everything in three days especially since urgency only came with the third day i had a semi broken success spiral on that one where i began to weasel and reschedule things that i sometimes could have just done i did get better at rejecting tasks after repeatedly feeling the pressure to do random things to which i had foolishly agreed success spirals backed up by simple tracking of success were the key habit for me starting tiny tracking success and slowly strengthening the habit of building habits this is how you tend your success spirals expenditures of willpower serve only to signal poor planning and a need to tweak the spiral where i am now it was too easy in a way after a few months of building these habits i realized that although i was learning a lot and living a richer life while raising my overall expectancy i wasn t getting very much skritter work done i was spending so much time studying and exercising and making friends that my work habit had gotten buried i hadn t noticed because i expected this to happen in costa rica and was willing to let work slide in favor of exploring jungles and speaking spanish and learning to swim and because the next interstitial month in pittsburgh was supposed to be hypersocial but when i got to silicon valley that summer and set myself to start seriously working again i found it difficult to break twenty hours a week while keeping all of these other habits i had just built i decided to relax my success spiral on the non work habits putting them into skeleton maintenance and to focus a success spiral on getting actual skritter development done i had an iphone app to write in chapter 7 startup man i continue the story of using success spirals for immense work productivity using new tools and a more sophisticated approach despite the shift in focus i didn t lose the habits i d developed after i completed that mission i extended my success spirals technique grown large and powerful after a year of

into doing all of these things regularly i would have missed practices stayed in bed late broken my internet embargo quit during the brutal workouts constantly checked email spent too much time reading and working and not enough on studying and not gone to sleep early enough at each point of decision to do or not do one of these things my old brain would have generated a stream of rationalizations about how i don t have to do it or can do it later or won t be able to keep it up anyway or i m too tired and had better take it easy but with my current expectancy levels i already know i m going to do it i hardly notice these rationalizations forming and when i do see one it is easy to recognize and destroy with a long history of realizing that i always feel better after i get up or work out or study or accomplish something no matter how tired or sore i think i am beforehand the generalized cue of i don t feel like it has been largely rewired from the quit response to the do it so i can feel better response this doesn t always work yet sometimes i do skip things particularly when they re not being tracked or seem less important or scheduling gets crazy sometimes i waste some time when it gets too easy and i don t need to challenge myself to accomplish everything as during the editing phase of this book i m getting better at doing it without being formal about it when i notice myself skipping something more important i take that as a cue to add more motivation hacks to make sure i do it since in the long run that s much easier than trying to keep doing it with sufficient but not excess motivation when i find myself wasting time i increase the difficulty by adding more pursuits the sword of last chance the tending of success spirals is a powerful technique but you don t get many chances with it especially after you consciously realize what you re doing each time you fall off the staircase the harder it will be to get back on since there will be a stronger voice of doubt in the back of your head telling you you couldn t do it last time or the time before that so why will this time be any different it s like breaking a bone that bone will be weaker for years each time you break it so you ll have to be move more carefully afterward most of us start with a lot of broken success spirals the sight of which is enough to make us lose confidence in our current attempts investor john templeton once said the four most expensive words in the english language are this time it s different your chances of tending a success spiral depend both on careful planning and on your ability to convince yourself that this time truly will be different this book contains many techniques to help with your planning since a good plan for succeeding at a goal contains many simultaneous motivation hacks as for convincing yourself that you will now succeed where you have previously failed i offer two weapons the first is the knowledge of how success spirals work with this knowledge you should be able to see why past attempts would have failed and i hope you can see how to make this next attempt succeed the second weapon is as sharp as sin and as delicate as memory i hesitate to give it to you either you ll use it to slash a desperate path to your dreams or you ll shatter it by forgetting or you ll cut off some part of yourself that you ll never get back i hope you will never need this weapon if you re already good at achieving goals if you re not stuck at the bottom of an expectancy pit wondering if anything will ever work or if you don t believe what i ve told you so far about how motivation works then you don t need this and can skip to the next chapter but if you re as i once was desperate and lost then hold out your hands steady your mind and take this it s the sword of last chance it s time to fight see when you know that you only have one chance left to change to become a motivated human being to start walking the path to success now or be ever lost in the darkness of broken expectancy then you are unleashed to try as hard as you can you will swing the sword and cut yourself free from neuroses and self defeating restraints you will go all in you will know that if you fail this time even if it s by holding back some effort that you think you might not need then you won t get another chance this is the kind of desperate effort that you need to break through the chains of doubt of many past failures i took the sword with me when i went to college knowing that if i couldn t pull my life together then i would never be able to do it my friend cathy remembers me telling her in a week i ll either be happy or dead 33 but you re not going to take this sword of last chance seriously unless you believe it s your true final tell my wife i love her last chance let me make you believe it self help usually doesn t work you flit from book to blog to friendly tip idly trying to improve and sometimes making a decent effort on some strategy that sounds exciting when these attempts fail you lose a little expectancy that the next attempt will work chew through enough self help advice without swallowing and soon you ll be sustaining yourself only on the fleeting taste of inspiration fantasizing success in place of pursuing it losing expectancy is a slow process because your brain is good at defending yourself the slow carb diet worked for a month so i could probably do it again but for real this time the autopilot schedule just doesn t work for me as soon as work is less crazy i ll definitely get in shape i ll use a better tool to block reddit next time i ll try harder at making friends when i switch jobs my friend told me about this dating book which was much better than the game so i ll do that next time these rationalizations dilute the impact of failures and they dilute future efforts since you can always find a reason why it wasn t your fault and another thing to half try next time if you realize the implications of this expectancy model and the mechanics of success and failure spirals though then these rationalizations lose power the harder you try the more likely you are to succeed but the more expectancy you will lose if you fail if you are facing a goal difficult enough to require all your effort then you stand to risk all future possibility of success if you try hard but not hard enough if you fail those rationalizations will not work your bone will be broken your success spiral shattered and your remaining expectancy gone and you will know it you won t be able to tell yourself that it was just because you didn t try or because you didn t have the right technique and that you ll try harder with a better method next time so you d better succeed this time this is why i have given you the sword a sharp manifestation of the realization that this is your last chance you have three choices you can steel your resolve and swing the sword putting together a motivation plan so powerful that there is no chance of failure the scary and hard part comes now committing to such a plan leaving yourself no retreat the sword in your hand is there to remind you of the stakes or you can lock the sword away until the time is right if you re reading this at a truly bad time for taking action then pick it up again at a better time and commit then but do not do it lightly most of the reasons for avoiding commitment now are deadly excuses if you can t make a motivation hacking plan right now then figure out an exact date when you can commit create a reminder for yourself and commit to taking up the sword then without further delay while you re waiting to begin talk yourself into it do not postpone a second time your last choice is to throw the sword of last chance away while looking cool and expressing disbelief that this is your last chance perhaps it s not perhaps you already are a motivation hero who knows how to accomplish goals and is reading this book to pick up useful motivation hacks rather than to fix weaknesses or perhaps you don t believe in this model of expectancy 34 either because you credit different science on the subject or because your brain has generated enough rationalizations to convince you that you don t need to believe it if you don t believe it please prove it to yourself by writing down a short explanation of how i m wrong then please help to correct me by emailing the explanation to nick skritter com all privacy assured it s terrifying to only have one chance left but it s also exhilarating as you make your decision to act you can feel the confidence flowing into you your brow furrows your back straightens your jaw tightens and your eyes narrow it s time to be the hero of your story it s unfortunate that your heroism will be a somewhat abstract effort of planning many motivational hacks instead of dashing through a burning building scooping up children or slugging criminals to defend the innocent since you don t come equipped with adrenal glands that fire when you sit down at your computer to map out goals i find that it helps to imagine oneself as a heroic rocky mulan churchill dragon warrior preparing for battle take up your sword chapter four precommitment skydiving challenge i twice rode the mystery mine ride at the mall of america where they sit you in a theater with a chair that lurches along with a short film of a truck careening down a mountain twice they had to stop the ride for everyone so some wimp could escape it was the same guy each time i mean come on how terrified of heights do you have to be before you d rather flee the theater in public shame twice than sit there with your eyes closed for ten minutes until it was over and why would you try it again after what happened the first time well i can t remember why i thought i d be braver the second time but the terror i felt is still clear today and it s much stronger than the embarrassment of being that wimpy guy who stopped the ride twice they had a kiddie roller coaster at the renaissance festivals in the summers and listening to the tiny kids doppler laughter coming from that ten foot tall dragon loop made me try it once that was enough to make me stay clear of roller coasters for the next ten years i went to cedar point with my startup cofounders and they somehow convinced me to ride the millennium force just once the two hours of waiting in line between the decision and the consequences helped as did the inability to quit once the roller coaster started moving i have a picture of myself sitting next to our inexcusably younger intern maksym who is smiling that blissful wind tunnel smile i am screaming that scream from the famous painting 35 plus tears snotting all over my face not screaming in enjoyment but screaming like you re dying as one friend said afterward yup still afraid of heights when i was brainstorming the goals for this book i wrote skydiving as a joke that night chloe s friends sent her a deal on skydiving she s even more afraid of heights than i am but she was on day two of a thirty day challenge to say yes to every invitation she could i could see her teetering on the fence and i nudged her if you do it i ll do it to support you she ll never do it she nudged me you could put it in your book and i nudged back we just have to do it sometime in the next three months easy and so on until we fell off the fence onto the side containing two coupons for terror we looked at each other oh fuuuuuuuuuck she said with skydiving the scariest part is the initial jump and you can give up right before that it s no big deal even lots of people chicken out at the last moment with the mystery mine ride and the roller coaster it s easy to get started you sit down they strap you in and you have a couple minutes to settle in and wonder how terrifying it can actually be and it s hard or even impossible to back out after the easy part but skydiving would give me an easy out when i would most want to take it and it would be about ninety times scarier than anything i had tricked myself into doing before if i was going to jump out of a plane i would need motivation stronger than my worst fear and if i wanted to enjoy the experience and not survive the torture then my motivation would have to be far stronger than my fear like a sumo wrestler facing an army of five year olds 36 precommitment precommitment also known as using a commitment device 37 is a versatile set of tools for increasing motivation in almost any situation to precommit is to choose now to limit your options later preventing yourself from making the wrong choice in the face of temptation publicly announcing your goal is a common form of precommitment precommitment reduces impulsiveness in the moment you want to bring near the consequences of not pursuing a long term reward in the form of a broken commitment if you stray off track instead of choosing between a cigarette now and good health years later you have to choose between a cigarette now and being able to tell your friend you re still clean or you can easily resist the temptation of a short term reward by removing it as an option in advance like not keeping any junk food in your house precommitment is an almost arbitrarily powerful motivation tool you can use it as weakly as thinking to yourself i m not going to have any dessert at lunch well not any cake maybe if they have apple pie i can have some since they don t make that often or cherry turnovers but no cake or you can max it out and use a commitment contract bind yourself to give your entire bank account to the church of scientology if you are discovered by any member of a team of private detectives to have knowingly eaten any foodstuff with more than 10 of calories from sugar between now and your cousin s wedding on july 18 unless the wedding is called off and not because of any plot on your part or two doctors judge that the sugar becomes medically necessary for your survival even weak forms can be useful although weaseling too much can backfire lessening your bond with yourself but the stronger the commitment 38 you make and the less weasel room you give yourself the more motivation you ll have you may object to motivating yourself from fear of punishment which could feel terrible but that s not how it usually works when you do it right what you want to do is motivate yourself with extremely high confidence of success which will feel great remember the motivation equation mevid m ev id or motivation expectancy times value over impulsiveness times delay motivation increases as expectancy of success increases and more motivation makes life more fun the resulting confidence and enjoyment are usually what make you succeed yes if something goes horribly wrong then the fear of failure from the precommitment will help you succeed anyway though it may be unpleasant but your goal is to minimize the likelihood of it even coming to that through careful planning if precommitment is traditionally an impulsiveness hack then the way i suggest doing it may be thought of pre overcommitment where you re hacking expectancy now since you know impulsiveness won t get you later you feel confident the whole time and it s not about the stakes the more difficult the goal then the more care you ll take when choosing your precommitment if you just want to make sure you go running before dinner then perhaps you ll just tell your dinner partner to call you out if you didn t go running but if you want to quit smoking for real this time then you are going to need to precommit to doing whatever terrifies you the most if you fail and to find an inescapable way to make sure you can t cheat without detection willpower will desert you when you need it most so you need enough precommitment to succeed even without any binding yourself is not that complicated and doesn t take long but the actual moment of precommitting is scarier than it sounds 39 after you commit it s not scary at all don t be scared into weakening the resolution you should bind yourself with something far beyond the scope of the goal you re trying to accomplish so that there s no contest your motivation should be much higher than needed to get the job done both so that you don t fall a little short and so that you have more fun if the thought of losing 100 can motivate you to go to the gym three times a week for a month then bind yourself with 1000 and watch yourself run cheerfully to the gym through the cold rain that you hadn t planned for if the goal excites you and the motivation is there then there will be a fire inside you to keep you warm and the rain and the cold will be puny obstacles for you to pulverize in your new hero boots skydiving solution i m writing this chapter about precommitment and skydiving on the fourth day of this project the actual skydive is at least a month away maybe two not too scary at this distance i m only trembling a little what precommitment devices shall i use everything i can think of 1 i ll give away 7 290 if i don t do it on or before august 25 2012 i put another 7 290 on finishing the first draft of this book by then 2 i ve already told chloe her friends all my human hacker housemates and a bunch of people at a party i ll tell my startup cofounders and i ll post it on twitter facebook and google i don t like using social networks but i haven t set up an appropriate public blog yet and i need to do this right now 3 i m writing this whole chapter about it in advance and it would be terribly inconvenient to have to rewrite it with a weaker example and to fail at something when i m writing a book about how to do the opposite every little bit helps 4 i already paid for it 5 chloe is counting on me 6 i ll nonchalantly email my twin brother who went skydiving no problem and tell him that i m going to go skydiving as if it s no problem too 7 i ll fix the date of the skydive now so that there s no chance of scheduling problems friends schedules dictate august 19 some of these things will motivate me less and some more i feel most nervous about binding all that money so i d better do it right now before i talk myself down done and i m no longer nervous i ll set up the other things now too it s important to commit now not later hyperbolic discounting makes it easier to commit the further in advance you do it and you also want to avoid the habit of putting off commitment as chloe always tells me if you can t do something now then set a specific time at which you will decide to either do it then or to never do it now that i ve precommitted far more than necessary i m so sure that i m going to successfully jump out of the plane that i m not afraid any more i m excited see my smile if only fourteen year old nick cowering before the kiddie coaster could see it now there s a guy who could have used some hope beeminder precommitting is simple when there s a single moment of success or failure you turn it into do or die moment and then you don t die but many goals are neither achieved with one jump nor failed with one drink what about losing thirty pounds or finishing a dissertation you need to make steady progress toward your goal by making far more good choices than bad ones even while the end result is still months away hyperbolically discounted until it s less important than a bagel or a round of call of duty 40 if you precommitted to losing thirty pounds by july 18 then by the time you hit july 1 and realized you d only lost ten your retripled efforts would still be too late you d miss your goal and the scientologists would get to spend your money on more mark vii super quantum e meters to assure success on goals like this you would have to dilute your commitment to something meaninglessly easy or to commit to some reliable behavior eating no desserts instead of the result you actually want losing weight allowing you to succeed in eating no desserts by chomping delicious pasta instead the solution is to precommit to staying on track toward your goal at all times not just by the end you need 500 more words on your dissertation every day and you need to be down at least one pound every two weeks if ever you fall short you die when your weight is in the danger zone two weeks in you ll see the reincarnated thetan of l ron hubbard 41 staring at you through the hole in that bagel yesss consssume carbohydrates your money is mine on monday you ll toss that cursed bagel and you ll soon learn to keep ahead of your goal so that you don t have to put up with the pressure then by the end there is no crunch time only success assured weight lost and a dissertation complete there are some complexities to this weight fluctuates words come slowly at first you may need to abort your scuba certification goal if you realize that you hate scuba diving or you might need to adjust the number of songs you re writing per week if they re taking too long you want to know exactly what you have to do and by when but to have some reasonable leeway built in you want escape clauses you want the ability to adjust the goal if needed but not just because of a moment of impulsiveness you want to see pretty graphs of your progress and you may want to make it public or put some money on it knowing that the money will actually vanish if you fail and so there was beeminder 42 beeminder is a web service which lets you set arbitrary process based goals and then holds you to them with all the reasonableness and firmness of your best friend who wants to see you succeed but won t take any more of your crap it s got great graphs which will please you when you re ahead motivate you when you re behind and share with you the fear of the death that your goal is about to die when it s time for you to be the uncomfortable hero of your story you can adjust any goal but the changes only take effect a week later which is far enough away to keep you honest you want to give up now but you can t and you don t want your future self to give up so you just keep going i ve used beeminder to make sure i was walking an hour a day developing quantified mind for three hours a week and working on the skritter iphone app for sixty hours a week many use it to lose weight to exercise to drink less to work more to keep their inboxes clear to waste less time surfing the web and to quit smoking most goals are a matter of effort over time and for those types of goals if they re important enough to warrant thirty seconds of bookkeeping a day you should use beeminder when writing this book i put most of its goals into beeminder without commitment contracts because i already know i never lose at any beeminder goal i had goals like talk to a hundred people 7 7 new people a week read twenty books one every 4 55 days learn 3 000 chinese word writings 33 a day and so on it s free at first but then if you fail a particular goal you have to pledge a commitment contract of 5 to retry it the first time 10 the second time 30 the third time 90 the fourth time and so on tripling with each subsequent failure time with write a book 1 000 words a day until the first draft was done and go skydiving do it before august 25 i emailed the beeminder crew and had them start me at 7 290 instead of working my way up here s the graph from the writing goal where i finished the first draft with six weeks to spare 43 read more and try it out at http www beeminder com it s almost always better than naive goal tracking methods 44 that only assess success or failure at the end and it s free until you fail the second time if you construct your success spiral well though you won t fail even once burnt ships one specific technique for precommitment is where you disable remove or destroy a distraction or temptation i call it burning the ships after the inaccurate story of hernán cortés who after landing his invasion force ordered his men to burn their ships 45 so that they wouldn t be distracted by the possibility of retreat when conquering the aztec empire you list possible distractions and then you make it so that it s impossible to do those things when you want to be working toward your other goals then instead of having to use willpower to prevent yourself from going to go grab a snack you realize that there are no snacks available and you get on with your flow if cortés were around today he d probably be one of us who turn our internet off apart from getting rid of your tv that s usually what this technique comes down to so maybe it should be called disconnecting the internet startup maven paul graham has an excellent essay about the acceleration of addictiveness 46 in which he argues that to live a good life one must become ever more eccentric in terms of saying no to the explosion of things that are designed to addict us many of which are now delivered via the internet whether you re hooked on facebook email news your blog comments cute kitten pictures words with friends youtube or even reading wikipedia it s harder to focus when a quick hit is right there on your computer or your phone do something about it whether it s keeping your phone in airplane mode until 5pm or turning off your laptop s wifi at all times except 11 00 11 30 am and 8 00 9 00 pm or maybe it s even having a separate computer with no internet connection in your home office and going over there to work even if you can resist these distractions while you re trying to focus why would you want to have to but i need internet to do my work if this is true then you can set up browser extensions to block the sites that you don t want to visit during certain times or whitelist the sites you do want to visit or make a 30 second delay before your browser loads any page to stop that compulsive typing of reddit com whenever you blank out for a second but if this is just an excuse if what you mean is that it s sometimes more convenient to be able to look things up then turn it off anyway and look things up later while writing this book i needed to know who the guy with the burnt ships was but for this book i turned my internet off when going to bed wrote during the mornings and only turned it on again after lunch so in the first draft the guy was the famous general really alexander hannibal when editing i then searched for every instance of the word really and did my research 47 this internetlessness was like a private beach for a man just let out of prison i had tried various schemes to limit my email checking to no more than three times a day or no more often than every 90 minutes and to stop surfing over to skritter com forum whenever i had to wait 30 seconds for my code to compile on good days i managed it often i weaseled sometimes i failed checking dozens of times at least i was no longer reading hacker news except when i did never went on social networks except once at the end of the day to post iphone app teaser bits for our users and cleared my well weeded blog feeds just twice a week i was still working almost all the time one week when i was gearing up to do 70 hours of real work high for me but not intense i did a one week timelapse of my screen 48 with my face in the corner and showed it to some friends figuring that it might be fun but that they would eventually skip through it but every one of them watched the whole seven minutes and exclaimed to me afterwards how inspiring it was that i never checked facebook i didn t think my focus was too great that week so many emails checked and rechecked but they were surprised by how good it was and i was surprised by how low their standards were here i was an internet addict being praised because i was functioning how bad are other people s addictions i don t know but if i was bad enough to need the internet turned off on me then you can judge for yourself whether any reaction along the lines of i don t need to turn it off is good sense or defensive rationalization i started doing internetless mornings on the first day of writing this book i also decided that i would only check email once per day between skritter work and dinner and when i did check it i would do all of it it was easier than i thought and far more effective i could feel my brain jerk itself up from my writing start bounding for the email turn and try the skritter forum make as if to google the phrasing of that gem like flame quote feint for the email again and then walled in on all sides by the knowledge that the internet was off sit back down and continue writing trying to pretend with dignity that it was just stretching this tapered off over a week and then my focus was always there my writing speed went from a crawling 340 words per hour to a somewhat less slow 500 and i compressed my daily 130 incoming and 13 outgoing messages into an hour why had this taken me so long to do i had read countless times that i should eliminate distractions and the first example was always to turn off the internet the second and third were usually to put on headphones and to set up a place to work where only work was allowed and nothing else maybe the answer is just that addiction is hard to admit or maybe it s easy and there are other books like this one except about addiction hacks instead of motivation hacks i don t know where you get the spark to start only how to fan it into an inferno once you have it chapter five social skills get ready for an example i want to give you an example of putting these motivation hacks success spirals precommitment and burnt ships into action all at once sometimes you ll face a goal which is so important it seems your life depends on it high value but which seems so impossible low expectancy that you d rather die the slow death of escapism high impulsiveness and ignore it until later high delay you need all the motivation you can get and you can t get any it s so uncomfortable to think about your creeping doom that you develop an ugh field 49 around it where your mind flinches away from thoughts about your goal the ugh field spreads from your goal to things related to your goal to things that remind you of those things and so on crushing debt is represented by bills which come in envelopes which are in your mailbox soon you can t even think about checking your mailbox without a shudder and a stiff drink when you re desperate it s time to fight with every weapon you can your weapons in this case are not the nerf bat of trying harder or the secret wand of easy weight loss no you ll wield the sword of last chance you ll make a plan to achieve your goal that requires time and effort and you will carefully hack your motivation so that you ll put in said effort if you have an ugh field surrounding your goal it will be hard to admit that you need to do this you might flinch away from the problem saying to yourself i need to finish transparent excuse before i can focus on reducing my drinking or i could probably start dating any time but i can wait until after this work project is done i find that journaling helps with this it s much easier for me to tell when i m lying to myself when i write things down or especially when i hesitate to write about something if it s not a problem then why am i so reluctant to engage it and prove that the example i will now give is the most important most rewarding goal i ve ever achieved i had to use success spirals precommitment burnt ships and a new environment i was missing something which i needed and thought i could never have i made a desperate plan followed it for years and acquired that missing piece many take this particular thing for granted and some struggle with it but few were ever as bad off as i was life without it was a combination of shame fear despair and years spent escaping into books and video games i lacked social skills social zero i was eighteen and i had no ability to talk to people outside my immediate family i had no friends my age any more i d lost them years ago after i couldn t muster the courage to ask them to hang out when my parents took my brother and me to taco bell i would cower behind my mother and beg her to order for me because the thought of saying eleven bean and cheese burritos no onions or sauce please was so terrifying that i d rather not eat my favorite food she wouldn t do it but my brother would the telephone was scarier than the dentist s drill i once went through an entire day of high school bus eight classes lunch and realized i hadn t said a single word i spent the rest of my time watching movies reading fantasy books and playing everquest a game in which i logged almost a year of play time over five years i felt like the ugliest lamest creature that ever had to lurch out of its cave i had no hope my lack of confidence had metastasized from my social skills to everything else i thought i sucked at writing despite my teachers praise i thought each new class would be too hard even though i d never been challenged in school i was sure i d never be able to work a job involving people talk to a girl make friends survive college drive a car play sports travel or enjoy anything outside of my own entertainment i had mastered the use of success spirals in reverse my expectancy was zero for everything except taking standardized tests and kicking ass as my everquest paladin warp whom i roleplayed as a cocksure maniac who thought he could do anything and because i was so addicted to that entertainment my impulsiveness was maxed out i would always choose escape over any other pursuit the delay of consequences was high since the soonest i d need to talk to anyone would be almost a year away when i would go off to college and i dreaded this so much that i never thought about it long ago having smothered it in an ugh field so even though the value of learning social skills would be incalculable the difference between life in the world and undeath in my room i had no motivation to try to save myself i convinced myself that this was okay even as i wrote angsty poetry about being a silent toad among songbirds and a rounded stone that never rolled too afraid to cry out for a push desperation that senior spring semester i got my push well it was more of a light breeze not enough to set me moving but enough to blow away a little of my ugh field i had taken a class called writer s workshop with mr mahle in the fall and as i had then run out of classes to take he gave me an independent study based on journaling when you have private writing assignments like write to yourself about your life path what do you know about where you are coming from and where you are going it gets tough to keep pretending that your life isn t a disaster heading for a catastrophe i had to admit my terror at the thought of always being that way of going to college in nine months of being forever alone but for frequent visits from shame in a desperate moment i decided that i would never change if i kept playing computer games and that if i quit right then maybe some miracle might occur and i would be able to try to perhaps attempt to learn how to live once i got to college this became a mantra once i get to college because that would be my last chance i dared to hope that i would someday get from mute to shy and even be able to order my own food i didn t hope that i d have real friends or anything impossible like that but maybe society could find some use for me i would never have been able to quit if it weren t for writing awful poetry it was the only thing that offered me emotions as powerful as those i d gotten from everquest and because i was such a slow writer it took up enough time to wean myself off the game i spent the rest of the time reading this new site called wikipedia which was a better addiction for me i kept journaling writing about how once i got to college i was going to talk to people how i was going to change how i was going to face my fears as if my life depended on it which it did this journaling was a form of precommitment nine months of telling myself that i would take action would force me to swallow those promises if i didn t follow through and knowing that helped make me believe that i could do it and while i couldn t bring myself to tell anyone else what i had planned for when i left i did somehow tell my family that i was quitting everquest which along with uninstalling the game helped me to stay away i should have sold my character 50 that would have been an even stronger burnt ship confidence man when i arrived at oberlin college that fall i had just enough motivation to try talking to people i almost couldn t do it but because i had so firmly fixed that first week as my time to do or die 51 my delay was small i had a deadline i knew that if i let the old nick come here to this new place he would never leave me i didn t eat anything except reese s cups for the first two days because i was too afraid to ask anyone where the cafeteria was and how i could get food turns out my dorm was the cafeteria dorm but i managed a few attempts one girl leah gave me a laundry bag my new roommate josh told me stories about portland another girl lauren asked me how i was and going for broke i told her how i had never been able to talk to anyone before and how scared i was i guessed that she would be weirded out and leave but she offered me sympathy conversation warmth i could hardly believe it everyone was nice to me they invited me into their games they waved me over to eat with them they didn t mind my shyness or my lack of grace it was all happening better than i had dreamt i even started dating a girl that first semester this is not to say it was easy i was still afraid with each new social thing that i tried to do and i fled from many things for which i wasn t ready but although i didn t know it i was on a success spiral and each new conversation fed my courage i was so happy to be alive at last that i kept my social goals tiny this allowed me to slowly grow the spiral without the risk of failure if i had tried to learn social skills faster then i would have failed at some point fallen off my spiral and lost faith in myself it almost happened a couple times instead i took it slow and over the next eight years i became ever better and more confident i m not saying that i m now the most social guy around bristling with friends and throwing parties like confetti that honor would be decided by a tough call between my twin brother zach and my startup cofounder george but i fearlessly danced like a moron at both of their weddings last week and about twenty people at each complimented me on my speech some telling me it was the greatest best man speech that they had heard rejection therapy learning social skills doesn t have to take eight years even from scratch i didn t know about motivation hacking when i stumbled into my plan or i could have set myself up to try harder and i could have done more effective practice than slowly warming up to whatever conversations and friendships happened to come my way with any skill you can come up with an exercise that will push you to just beyond your limits where learning comes the fastest and you already know how to use precommitment to get yourself to do the exercise here s an exercise that i did to help with talking to strangers and asking for things it s called rejection therapy 52 most people feel reluctant to approach strangers and ask for things they want the most classic example is the guy who is afraid to walk up to an attractive girl and start a conversation or get a phone number you might be afraid to ask if you can join a game of frisbee or if you can sit with some group at lunch or if some guy would be willing to let you practice your chinese with him and even if you have no problem doing these things there is a world of meaningful encounters which can be unlocked by making strange requests that cut through protective politeness patterns whether with strangers or acquaintances or friends will you go on a vision quest with me may i learn the art of collodion wet plate photography from you can i test drive your subaru impreza wrx sti lancer evolution superduty gt quad core hemi sport with the twin turbos and dtrls you don t get to play basketball with the president 53 or sell your own breakfast cereal 54 if you re not comfortable putting yourself out there and hustling why should we fear rejection we can guess at an evolutionary psychological explanation that when you lived in a tribe of 50 people being rejected by one of the four eligible mates would mean losing a quarter of your dating pool so it would make sense to be cautious and avoid possible rejection but today s dating pool is much larger and most of the strangers you could make a fool of yourself in front of will never see you again there is no longer much need to fear rejection from strangers rejection therapy is an exercise designed to get you over this useless fear it uses the psychological tactic of flooding you expose yourself to the terrifying stimulus over and over until you get over it and instinctively realize there s nothing to be afraid of there are a few different flavors like the thirty day challenge where you must be rejected at least once per day but the one that i did only took an hour some friends and i walked downtown together joking nervously about what we were going to do we agreed to meet again in an hour to recount the stories of our many rejections and then headed off alone in different directions the mission was to approach as many strangers as possible and ask them for things which we actually wanted which would likely be rejected which left us in a vulnerable position instead of the other person and which were not so implausible as to no longer be scary i had a time limit a social expectation and a precommitment to doing it so i fought down my terror and started asking for things can i take your picture may i try on your hat will you tell me a secret can i have a free ice cream will you give me a tour of the library can you tell me about the economics of panhandling can i play that pac man for free may i ride in the bookmobile a surprising amount of people said yes i got the ice cream i didn t get the library tour or the bookmobile ride but the librarian was summoned and he told me a ghost story about the library which he d only shared with a few people no one let me take their picture but i have a picture of me trying on a crazy hat i went from initially terrified to mostly chill by the end of the hour and that desensitization has stuck with me ever since 55 after the hour was up i met up with my friends one guy had gotten three hairs from people s heads to cast a spell to summon an artificial intelligence to battle the evil god cthulhu one girl had gotten a free bike lock and a ride on someone s bike one guy failed to get anyone to meditate with him and another couldn t get anyone to give him a dollar another got to try on several people s shoes one guy asked for and received a nice jacket which we later priced at 150 everyone had reaped years of confidence in an hour one friend pointed out another useful benefit of this exercise which was that it made obvious what it felt like to be rationalizing making excuses to yourself when you make yourself the rule i m going to ask the next person i see if i can have a hug and then you see someone who looks particularly terrifying to approach your brain will try to help you out with some rationalizations except for her since she s too pretty too old too young walking with someone going somewhere too tall too looking like she doesn t want to be bothered this feeling of wanting or not wanting to do something for a basic reason fear laziness hunger etc and then giving yourself a higher level excuse for why that s okay should trigger alarms whenever you notice it note that this rationalization is also how most goals die you convince yourself that it s okay to not do what you told yourself you would do and if you can develop the habit of noticing it and defeating it then you ll be more effective in achieving your goals i fixed twenty unpleasant bugs that i d been avoiding for months in the first three days after i started practicing the noticing of rationalization i later lost the habit which is a tough one later i ll try another exercise to get myself to hold onto the skill of avoiding rationalization more exercises rejection therapy is one example of an exercise that gives huge gains in a short time if you can bring yourself to do it with the powers of precommitment you can set yourself up to do many such exercises building skills and getting over fears in no time another such exercise is the eye contact exercise most of us don t make enough eye contact i don t know if i buy the stories about how all you need to do is look people in the eyes and everyone will trust and like you no one will be able to resist you or tell whether you re lying and you ll be promoted to chief billionaire in six months but it s plausible that life is better seen through eyes than shoes and horizons so i practiced with some guy i hardly knew we decided to look into each other s eyes for fifteen minutes noting each time the other guy looked away it was uncomfortable at first and i didn t want to do it but it was enough for me to get over my discomfort and look into people s eyes from then on this worked with the other people i knew who also tried it i was going to do the same exercise with hugs where you would hug someone unfamiliar for fifteen minutes but i missed the exercise and never rescheduled long hugs and bro hugs still discomfort me writing this makes it clear that i need to find a stranger and do the hug exercise this is a scary thought so i will use precommitment to bind myself to actually do it while setting the date to be far enough in the future so that it s not so scary right now that i won t commit you could design similar exercises for any small skill that you need to acquire or any large skill which can be broken down into smaller skills 56 lifehacker luke muehlhauser has broken down social skills into a map of such skills 57 from handshakes to reading faces to hairstyle which you can look through to find techniques to learn or to see how you might apply the technique to other areas as an example you might break down front crawl swimming into dozens of skills from breathing into the water to having your hand enter the water without splash to rotating your body with each stroke then you could come up with a drill for each skill stand in the pool and breathe in above water and out below water a bunch of times stand there and push your arm smoothly into the water for five minutes hold your breath for a few strokes while you focus only on making sure you rotate enough so while learning the front crawl by trying to do the front crawl should seem too difficult learning to do it by learning each subskill one by one should seem encouragingly easy if you break it down far enough with many skills and drills it s good to get feedback on your technique because you don t want to practice the wrong things in the wrong ways this isn t an excuse not to practice it doesn t take much coaching to get started chapter six time coins you have to choose my favorite quote is i luv this song its grate i rememebr whn i first hurd it when i was six a ran around the rfrontromm lol 58 my second favorite quote comes from the poet carl sandburg time is the coin of your life it is the only coin you have and only you can determine how it will be spent be careful lest you let other people spend it for you when you hack your motivation you grow rich in time coins rich enough to buy almost any life you could want this makes it even more important for you to decide what life you want most of us spend our time coins doing jobs that other people have given us to do saving the rest for entertainments that other people are trying to sell us why do we not destine greater roles for ourselves why aren t we lion tamers astronauts champion martial artists powerful rappers or international spies why don t we make our own magician s magazines brew up beatboxing bacteria race rally cars or shoot explosive arrows a few of us do these things but what is keeping the rest of us from the most fulfilling exciting value filled lives we can imagine if you re like most of us the answer is some mix of i can t do that i have to do this instead and i never thought of it and now it s too late some of these excuses are true you aren t going to play pro basketball if you re 5 3 59 you ll have to pay off most of your debt before you can start your own business if you have tiny children don t run off on your own to the shaolin temple to master kung fu bring them but most of these excuses are rationalizations borne from low expectancy if you aren t good at something yet then hack your motivation to spend the time practicing and you ll become great 60 if you need to work a job to survive then motivate yourself to hack at your goal outside of work save money or find a better job if you don t know how to do something then motivate yourself to spend the time figuring it out many stories are told of ordinary unfulfilled folks who late in life suddenly challenged themselves and changed everything to realize their dreams many more such stories are never told because their protagonists never protagonized effort can solidify almost any dream and motivation hacks can ensure effort with so many goals in front of you how do you choose you don t want to end up as a mistaken entrepreneur who should have been a dancer just because you read a book which lent you its author s dream in place of your own spending time coins without a plan is expensive but at least you have feedback mechanisms like boredom stress and depression to tell you when you re living your life wrong when you hack motivation you sever those nerves you ll need to instead rely on high level planning and introspection to figure out what you should be doing i was presenting a time graphing design for making work more rewarding and one guy objected that he had been a programmer and it had eventually become frustrating enough that he quit and changed industries and if he had artificially made it more fun to work as a programmer then he never would have been forced into a better career my friend divia answered better than i could pain and pleasure indicators cannot take the place of being strategic about one s goals so even though this is a book about motivation and not goals i would feel cruel without writing a chapter on making sure you know what you want before making sure that you re going to get it goal picking exercises sometimes it seems as if there are more exercises for choosing your goals than there are goals worth choosing this is okay pick your favorite exercises and do them i ll offer three good ones that you can use 1 imagine your ideal day what do you do whom do you talk to where do you go then pick a few goals that will bring your days closer to this ideal 2 make a list of every crazy goal you can think of then rate each goal on three factors how much the goal excites you from one to ten your probability of success if you tried as hard as you could and how long it would take in hours 61 then sort the goals by excitement times probability of success divided by time required and pick some of the most efficient goals 3 imagine that you re another person more competent than yourself who was just dropped into your current life at this moment without any of your current obligations but with all of your current predicaments forget everything that has come before and where you used to be going what would you do this is an exercise in overcoming the sunk cost fallacy 62 i did all three of these for this book project with a three month limit i imagined an ideal day for myself waking up at the crack of dawn getting exercise and early sun before anyone was up reading and studying chinese in a park waking chloe up for breakfast and so on i made a spreadsheet of a ton of cool goals i could do in three months and realized i had time for all of them if i cut out hang gliding and dancing too much time as well as learning the guitar not exciting enough i hadn t thought of learning skateboarding knife throwing or lucid dreaming before but once brainstormed those goals kept striking me and i knew they wouldn t take long i started the whole project by taking the outside view of my situation and asking would a protagonist keep striving desperately on his startup even after desperation gave way to prosperity no he would strive to ignite all the freedom he had earned when you do pick your goals forget the advice about smart goals 63 use piers steel s slightly improved csi approach your goals should be challenging if they re not exciting they won t provide value specific abstract goals can leave you vulnerable to impulsiveness since it s not clear what you need to do immediate avoid long delayed goals in favor of ones you can start now and finish soon and approach oriented as opposed to avoidance goals where you try not to do something you should instead reframe it positively as an attempt to do something it just feels better i talk more about this in chapter 12 mistakes bad ways to dream there are many bad ways to pick your goals watch out for them don t use them in the future and re examine any current goals that came from them a terrible way to pick your goals is to do what society wants you to do to chase prestige don t do things to win the respect of people you don t know instead do things that you and people whom you respect care about paul graham puts it best prestige is just fossilized inspiration if you do anything well enough you ll make it prestigious 64 paul also tells a cautionary tale about his friend who knew when she was in high school that she wanted to be a doctor she was so motivated that she persevered through every obstacle including not actually liking her work she s a successful doctor and she hates it now she has a life chosen for her by a high school kid this is another source of bad goals childhood dreams some childhood dreams are originally ours and some grow on us but most were given to us at a time when we didn t know any better about what we liked if what you re clutching is no longer a dream but a memory of one then drop it bad goals often take the form of intermediate steps you might want to be rich if so then go do something that will make a lot of money don t go to college fight your way out of debt work your way up and then be rich that s safety not wealth and if you want to play in a band or sail around the world or write novels then don t make money first you ll have lost your passion by the time you look for it sometimes there are no exciting paths to an exciting goal you can t be a doctor without years of schooling but do you want to be a doctor or do you want to heal people gatekeepers will tell you that you need to crawl before you can walk before you can be certified to begin run past them watch out for things that you have always been good at it always seems to make sense to keep doing them to build on your previous accomplishments and to play to your strengths this can lead to greatness but it can also be a trap i had always been good in school and so i kept taking classes in all of my best subjects before i knew it i graduated with 142 out of 112 credits highest honors a triple major in computer science applied mathematics and east asian studies and only two close friends my startup cofounders my college adventure count was low and i never used my high gpa 65 my degree or anything i learned in those extra classes i slept through 66 that was dumb the only thing it s good for is impressing people i don t know so i try not to bring it up except in warnings not to play others games i hope you are not impressed goals that are too easy are goals that won t excite you there is not enough value in lose five pounds to make you care it s too safe it s probably easier for the overweight motivation hacker to lose fifty pounds than fifteen because he ll know he needs to try harder and he ll want it more the daily process of achieving the goal is the same but it takes longer and gives him more value it s not even a real increase in delay since he is rewarded throughout the process and not just at the end a sure way to kill motivation is to water down the challenge this seems as if it contradicts expectancy and the idea of success spirals where you make sure you can t lose but the key is to set your success spirals around the process i expect that i can use beeminder to make sure i lift weights twice a week while deriving your value from the results i m getting stronger and one day i ll deadlift 500 pounds you can t quite guarantee that effort will lead to success but you can guarantee effort and that almost always leads to success eventually if you just don t quit the biggest source of goals both good and bad is stories of what other people have done if you read enough about startups you ll want to do one perhaps forgetting that you value financial security if your friends all start running you may find yourself running with them even though you actually hate it growing up watching romantic comedies will give you horrible ideas about what you want from a lover go ahead and travel the world but pay attention to whether you enjoy it then there are the other types of stories not of action and adventure but of common contentment most people you know work jobs buy things go out entertain themselves and eventually start families these may not be necessary goals for you moderation in all things they say that may keep a society together but it s not the protagonist s job on happiness humans don t know what makes us happy we think we know but we re usually wrong psychologist daniel kahneman draws a distinction between the experiencing self and the remembering self 67 we have two modes of thinking about well being the experiencing self which can semi accurately tell you how happy you are in the moment if you ask yourself and the remembering self which can make up reasonable sounding lies about how happy you were in the past or about how happy something will make you in the future life is made up of a series of moments the happiness and unhappiness within a life is integral the area under the curve of the happiness of those moments only a tiny fraction of a life is experienced in a reflective mode since we don t spend much time consuming memories in other words the well being described by the remembering self is an illusion 68 you could call the well being given by the experiencing self happiness and that given by the remembering self life satisfaction unfortunately for us the remembering self makes all the planning decisions charting all of our goals across its bizarre cognitive geography we ignore process and focus on conclusion we overestimate both negative and positive impacts of possible events we hyperbolically discount like a fishmonger going out of business and we make disconnected events fit into consistent life stories we end up with bad goals that don t make us happy while we re achieving them and which give only fleeting satisfaction when we re done almost all attempts to increase our happiness end in failure because we don t understand what actually makes us happy and when you set yourself up to accomplish a goal no matter how unpleasant the process is that s not a recipe for well being i say again it is dangerous to hack motivation with the wrong goals whenever you override instincts with higher cognitive processes you d better do it well because otherwise you ll hurt yourself it s like lifting weights if you don t learn proper form an injury will leave you weaker than if you hadn t even tried my solution to calibrating my remembering self s planning to my experiencing self s well being is to randomly ping myself to record my happiness right now along with what i m doing a timestamped alert comes in on my phone or laptop about every three hours and i type in a 1 10 happiness number 69 and a couple tags for whatever is making me feel good or bad an example entry might be 2012 06 12 tue 03 17 7 music iphone app launch there are many ways to measure experiential happiness so find what works for you you might be able to just develop a habit of mentally interrupting yourself to ask how you re doing and why but if you re human don t neglect this humans don t know what makes us happy so measure 70 i agreed to go whitewater rafting thinking outdoor action adventure this is going to be a lot of fun when the day came though i remembered to sample my experiential happiness throughout the trip not using my phone but with constant attention here s the breakdown two uncomfortable hours in the car on the way there at a happiness level of 4 10 an hour waiting to start at a neutral 5 an hour of rafting at 6 short bursts of 8 when we went through rapids another hour of 4 as i developed a headache from eating only the terrible sandwiches the guides brought for lunch the last headache hour of the rafting at 5 with brief 8s two starved and nauseous hours at 3 on the way home a one hour 5 dinner where we d all run out of things to say average experiential happiness for those nine hours 4 47 my average happiness was 6 18 for the month before that mostly from sitting at home listening to music and writing code bad planning remembering self and if i hadn t measured it my remembering self would probably have told me just days later that yeah it was a long car ride but what a blast those rapids were watch out for low fun density my two years of happiness tracking has surprised me 71 i thought sunny weather was crucial for me and wanted to move from pittsburgh to california nope weather was only 3 of happiness and 1 of unhappiness i moved to california anyway but for the people not the weather my happiness from music used to be 14 and i hadn t taken any time to manage what music i listened to when i found that out i spent two days organizing my music collection to cull the bad stuff increasing the density of enjoyable songs and bringing that up to 22 increasing my overall positive happiness by 10 not bad for two days of effort now almost all my happiness comes from enjoyable work 25 music 22 and feeling accomplished 10 72 my unhappiness which is about half as large as my happiness is split between work 18 lack of accomplishment 16 tiredness 12 and physical discomfort 12 this is after improving previous problem areas like others negativity and reading hacker news and other internet media but i noticed some low overhead high value activities in there that i rarely did reading books writing reading pyromania playing short rounds of video games with friends and photography looking at these activities i already had a good idea of how i should fill my days during this project i had been having a lot of fun lately just working and listening to music but i wanted to do better than that i measured my average happiness for the three months before i started this book 6 3 10 the highest it had ever been i decided that the next three months should double my happiness raising it whole point to 7 3 10 to hit a 7 on my scale i have to visibly look happy smiling rocking my head to music or staring determined at my work with fire in my eyes i knew that i d need goals that kept me burning all day to pull it off the goals you choose should do the same they should drench you in value and then ignite you chapter seven startup man a lifetime of work paul graham once wrote that doing a startup is a way to compress your whole working life into a few years 73 working on your own startup can provide more motivation than anything else i know you do those forty years of work in four years because you have to but also because it s fun this chapter uses the story of my startup skritter as a study in motivation you don t have to have a startup to see how you might apply a startup style combination of high expectancy high value low impulsiveness and low delay to transform your motivation environment for me the best thing about doing a startup wasn t the financial freedom i achieved but the lesson in how it feels to love what you re doing after finishing that first ¾ lifetime 74 of work i m aiming to work at least a few more lifetimes it s more fun than simply having fun an idea that doesn t suck it was 4 a m in beijing and i awoke in my friend s chinese dorm room with a cold near deafness from my flight and total confusion as to where i was i had just returned from three weeks of hearts and rainbows volunteering at an ngo 75 in chongqing with innocent chinese college girls to spend two days with some rowdy american students and i had a massive case of reverse culture shock when i got to beijing i met them at a restaurant where they d spent the last eleven hours drinking eating pizza and playing cards with the mohawked owner they were so drunk that i won twenty consecutive rounds of a card game to which i didn t know the rules because my ears felt as if they were fifteen feet away from my head my waking life felt more surreal than the dream i had just come from and that was before i saw nick hatt hatt had also come to china that winter term of junior year from oberlin college to research the beijing underground rap scene not to volunteer at an ngo was also a computer science and east asian studies major was also named nick and was also staying in my childhood friend clark s dorm room i thought i was hallucinating when i saw him since he had no affiliation with clark and there are a lot of dorm rooms in beijing realizing that we had the same 7 30 am flight out from beijing did not help convince me of my lucidity nor did the plan to hit a chinese mcdonald s at 4 30 am beforehand i had gotten three hours of sleep that night but hatt had apparently stayed up chugging water and playing his nintendo ds to stay awake my surreality dial broke off at 11 when i asked him what he was playing it s this game where you re a ninja surgeon and you have to perform surgery in combat while other ninjas try to kill you each incision flashes onto the screen and you have to react quickly to trace the stroke and cut the patient open he responded not in chinese from far away i could not process this i think i just moaned at him but in that moment he gave me an idea which would go on to win me financial freedom to learn chinese well one must learn thousands of chinese characters ranging from as simple as the one stroke character 一 yī one to more complicated than the 36 stroke 齉 nàng snuffle students of chinese build mountains of flashcards for these characters which eventually fall over and crush the students some students survive giving up the idea of learning to write and instead crawling to shaky reading only literacy after a thousand hours of study after three exhausting semesters of chinese my writing was already collapsing so when i saw hatt scratching out those surgical strokes on his screen i thought wouldn t it be great if i could learn the strokes of chinese characters with some stroke based handwriting recognition game i came home told the story a few times and forgot about the idea for a few months until i needed a senior computer science honors project topic i was babbling to my friend ben about some ant colony optimization algorithm visualization when he said no that s stupid what about that chinese writing algorithm you were talking about i sputtered for a few moments about how that wouldn t i mean it might not well i suppose i could but hmm ben stared at me until i admitted that s not such a bad idea i had been reading all these posts on hacker news about how one should do a startup instead of getting a job and my roommate george had previously agreed to do a startup with me if i could find an idea that didn t suck and if i would stop bothering him because he had to do his economics homework i convinced him and my other roommate scott that the idea didn t suck i skipped half of my math classes to hack on the stroke recognition algorithms we won 30 000 from the college s creativity leadership fund to get started we found a cheap apartment in town and we were off as soon as we graduated overnight we went from working as little as we had to for school to as much as we could for ourselves we ran into setbacks fought terrible bugs designed bad interfaces fundraised in uncomfortable shoes lost almost all our users when we started charging incinerated cash in google adwords rewrote everything again and again built features that didn t matter marketed ineffectively and spent a wrist searing january with thirty one cloudy days typing in chinese english dictionary entries assembling thousands of characters stroke by stroke and hunching over a stroke classification tool i built called the drudge but we loved it and without a schedule or any deadlines we found ourselves doing fifty hours of real work a week why what was it about the startup that gave us so much motivation motivation extravaganza i ll break down our startup experience into factors affecting the four terms of the motivation equation these factors will suggest more general techniques that you can use in shaping your own motivation environment expectancy we were committed we committed to at least a year for the 30k grant we didn t have any other fallbacks and we told everyone we were doing it with your goals do the same don t leave yourself any safe ways to fail and you ll be more confident of success we focused our expectancy on the process not the result startup success is a gamble which does detract from expectancy but we d read paul graham s advice for startups just don t die and you ll succeed eventually he was right in our case if you never give up you ll make it even if you have to try many different approaches we didn t know whether our startup would make money but we did know we would work hard and not disgrace our families many goals are similar don t worry about winning just ensure that you ll keep going we were overconfident first time startup founders underestimate the difficulty of creating something great everyone said it would be hard but luckily for us we couldn t understand them we ll pitch the investors with twenty million in revenue after three years silly investors we ll only be making four million by then mm hmm goals won t always trick you this way but when they do be grateful you are capable of more than you know 76 so the larger the challenge the better we had cofounders i would never have gotten through some of the bug mountains if scott hadn t been there digging next to me george would have gotten a part time job and or killed himself if i hadn t balanced his revenue projection pessimism with my optimism scott would have burnt out if george wasn t the funnest guy on the planet when you hit a low by yourself it s hard to get out of it when your bros just keep going you ll stumble after them even if you ve lost the light only to find that it was just ahead at the next bend don t strive alone if you don t have to 77 value we chose the most important thing we d ever done there was a direct connection between our work each day and the lifetime of freedom we d win if we succeeded pick goals that matter to you we worked for ourselves in a three person startup you do only tasks that you decide need doing because you want them done or because you want to help out your best friends writing a twenty page faq is easier than writing a bogus two page paper on the feminine gaze in hiroshima mon amour do your own thing not someone else s we worked for our users we made it so easy for users to contact us that thousands of them did many to tell us how much they loved skritter when i had it s a truly amazing amazing site and your site s signup page is down in my inbox i hungered to work when i was building a huge new feature that no one was trying yet that was when i struggled with motivation this is part of why they say you should launch early find a way to get people counting on you and appreciating your struggle we picked a fun startup to build skritter is almost like a game and we got to do a lot of fun things with it even put in a few explosions here and there fun is part of value it s much easier to make money building maximally unsexy products like inventory management software because there s less competition for boring work but we wanted to make something cool even if it was less profitable and indeed we made almost nothing for the first two years that part sucked you might be more motivated by mountains of cash than we were but don t overlook the fun factor enjoying something is part of doing it well we picked a fun way to build it we worked from home and our headquarters was our guest bedroom we got to work closely together listen to music eat lunch on the porch and play games and blow things up after dinner this was so much fun that we wanted to keep the startup going just so that we could keep hanging out merge your goals into the lifestyle that you want to lead we had enough energy we slept as much as we wanted since there was no schedule we got exercise avoided processed food and ate healthy dinners that scott cooked for us we did eat cereal for breakfast and succumbed to the simplicity of pasta when there weren t enough leftovers so sometimes we did get tired in the afternoons but we d just go for a walk around the neighborhood when that happened everything is more fun when you re awake to ensure focus optimize your energy levels we shielded each other from terrible tasks now with just three guys we each still had to do almost everything including many unpleasant value less tasks some of which i listed earlier scott and i hated business paperwork and would sooner flee the country than get our lawyer to sign the amended articles of incorporation george disliked it less so he took care of it he hated using facebook and twitter to manage our social media presence so i did that frustrating chore scott minded accounting less so he accounted and he cooked saving george and i from endless repeats of the bean dish each of us was more willing to take his bullets when he saw the others doing the same i use this technique all the time with chloe too i ll do the laundry what will you trade me dinner deal 78 unlike with money we all have different preferences for chores so trade tasks with someone and you can both get great deals impulsiveness we created a work environment that afforded only work this sounds like the opposite of working from home but in our case we had always worked from that home so it was an easy habit wake up start working i did have to put a rubber duck on my right speaker to signal george when not to ask me what i thought about buying some katanas or how many twizzlers a bear could eat but that was a solvable problem one advisor told us that we should get an office because that s where you re supposed to work you won t get distracted in an office so you ll be more productive poor guy avoiding distractions doesn t mean driving twenty minutes away and renting space where there s nothing fun to do find or create a new environment and use it only for work even if it s just for set times of day leave bad habits at your new door and they ll stay out we didn t have much else to do we were in a college town of 8 000 people and most of our friends had graduated it s not usually a good thing to have nothing in life but work but it did help us focus later when we moved the startup to costa rica our focus was no match for the jungles and rivers and mountains and surfing and ticos 79 so we didn t get much done apple cofounder steve jobs said that you should stay hungry 80 in order to do great things if your life is full you won t have the same drive as a desperate man this doesn t matter for many goals but watch out if you re trying to compete with those hungry desperados they want it more than you do so you ll have to be extra smart about structuring your motivation in order to work as hard as they will we were around people who were working each other we didn t have a schedule or any rules about how much to work we could each just read a book in the middle of the day if we wanted but when you ve got a guy in the same room soldiering on for your shared destiny then it doesn t feel right to slack off this was actually a problem for george because as the designer he often got way ahead of us developers 81 and would run out of work to do especially when we weren t fundraising he d see me there at night striving to code up an interface he d mocked up and his top gear episode would blur with tears of frustration at not being able to work more surround yourself with motivated people we played hard after dinner we d usually go and play super smash brothers for forty minutes which i measured as one of the most fun things i can do as long as i don t overdo it george had a built in smash guilt timer and when it went off he d stop playing so we were forced to keep it short and fun dense on nights when we didn t smash we d go off and read interesting articles on hacker news for a couple hours and not feel half as charged up afterwards if scott and i had gotten too much better at smash than george he would have quit playing and skritter would have died fortunately we found some other fun things to do metalocalypse thermite an illegal laser guitar hero steel wool spark showers a bad ass knife worms short films a giant fresnel lens dry ice street art and quoting wizard people dear reader at each other instead of speaking english 82 because we knew we were going to max out on fun together after dinner why would we waste work time playing a mildly fun tower defense game collect fun dense 83 activities then do those instead of spending more time on wimpy leisure distractions delay we always thought we were almost there on the surface the delay inherent in a startup seems motivation killingly high it can be years or never before you start making the money you could make tomorrow in a normal job but unlike with fixed duration goals like medical school success never feels years away when we started we thought we d launch in six months it took twelve and either be rich or broke in two years it took four we thought every new feature would catapult us into prosperity only one of hundreds did auto renewing credit card subscriptions that each trade conference would spread our name throughout the land not yet that each marketing campaign would double our traffic nope and that each interface redesign would solve all our problems it took six iterations before new users could make a vocabulary list more than half the time everyone thinks this way and it s called the planning fallacy 84 i think it s great everything takes longer than we think but if we planned accurately we d give up right away when you re always almost done the delay before your reward seems short and so your motivation is high you don t have to do anything to take advantage of this even recognizing that it always takes longer won t save you from underestimating we released early and often every time we improved something we couldn t wait to show it to our users and so we didn t wait we uploaded it to the site right away this caused a lot of bugs but it was way more fun than monthly releases and extensive quality assurance testing one day i decided that i would translate the entire handwriting recognition algorithm from server side python to client side actionscript 3 excited by the thought of stroke recognition being instant and wanting to surprise scott george and the users i hacked for ten hours straight using my epic motivation to write 1 000 lines of mathematically complex code that worked without logic errors the first time i ran it usually i m lucky to write ten lines without a mistake it was live the next morning when everyone woke up to hail me as a hero i didn t give myself a deadline but a challenge and the thought of immediate glory made me work far better than normal for motivational highs kill delay look for ways to do something amazing right away iphone app after two and a half years we escaped the too cozy bubble of oberlin ohio and took the startup to costa rica for ten weeks in preparation for going remote so that george and i could be with our girlfriends and scott could travel the world as we left that motivation rich work environment we immediately dropped down to 24 hours a week and even that was a struggle in costa rica lurked adventure and uncomfortable chairs then pittsburgh where chloe was in grad school held new friends puzzle hunts and rock climbing she and i spent a summer in silicon valley and with all the less wrong rationalists 85 quantified self lifehackers and hacker dojo 86 entrepreneurs competing for my fascination skritter work was stalled at the 21 hours a week needed to fix bugs answer email and sputter meaninglessly on the skritter iphone app i wanted desperately to finish the app but i couldn t make myself do the work i had more bugs than ever i was discouraged about my low work output i was no longer hungry i didn t have my bros at my side i had everything instead of nothing else to do and i could see that the iphone app was many months away expectancy and value were low impulsiveness and delay were high and my motivation was gone by this time i d learned about the motivation equation and realized that i needed to consciously design a motivating environment if i hoped to reach my goal and have any fun doing it i was like an athlete relearning how to move after an injury i had lucked into a great motivation environment before but now i needed to put one together from scratch to increase my expectancy i started a success spiral on my weekly iphone app development hours starting low at first so i knew i could do it and putting it on beeminder so i knew i would do it the value of finishing the app was already high but the value of working on it was low fixing bugs sucked and no one was using it yet and encouraging me i decided to ignore the bugs for now and scramble on building the features i d need to start alpha testing since i d like fixing bugs more when i had users to fix them for this helped decrease my perceived delay since it was no longer months until finishing the app but weeks until hitting alpha it turned out to be months for alpha and almost another year until launch but luckily i underestimated and to limit impulsiveness i started using timeboxing 87 allowing only a set short time to work on something for my email waking up early and doing app development first while i wouldn t be distracted and trying to cut back on the other things i was pursuing until only the coolest remained of everything i did using beeminder to precommit to build my success spiral and to visualize my progresss was the most helpful when i got back to pittsburgh after that summer in california i had managed to increase my daily iphone development hours from 1 3 to 2 7 during the preceding month still mostly doing website maintenance but enough to show me that i could do more on the app i cranked that beeminder up to five hours a day of iphone app development and held on for my life for the first three months i skated the edge of death never more than a day s work away from failing my beeminder goal but progress came and my expectancy grew stronger along with it we launched our alpha version and users loved it we bought scott a macbook and brought him in on the iphone app too value went up since he could do some of the parts i didn t want to and i had more fun working together than on my own even though it was remote delay decreased as we got closer to launch although we continued to underestimate the remaining work i became better and better at saying no to activities that had a low fun density and as chloe became busier finishing her master s and my other housemates learned that i was a badass samurai of work on a quest of ferocious focus distractions diminished after recharging with a five friend two week trip to mexico and guatemala in january motivation was bursting out of me i soared over my beeminder target of five hours a day at this point i was having so much fun with the app that my goal had changed from work enough to work as much as possible my average happiness climbed to 6 3 the highest i had ever sustained burnout was not a concern beeminder was no longer exerting any pressure since i didn t need it any more even after increasing the goal rate a couple times i switched to a method of graphing my work time devised by psychologist seth roberts which he called percentile feedback 88 the idea is that you graph your progress throughout the day as a percentage of the day spent working since you woke up and at the same time you plot it against all the previous days so that you can see how you re doing compared to the past this gives you a percentile score at any point throughout the day which you can always meaningfully increase by working more instead of only seeing how much work i d done at the end of the day when it was too late to motivate me i could see at any moment how much i d done how good that was and how much more i could do if i kept at it the first day of percentile feedback i was so excited to see my work percentile climb that i did more iphone app development in a day than i d ever done before twelve hours this was exciting and i measured that i got more done per hour and had more fun doing it the longer i worked each day i didn t have to beat my best each day only my average i decided to set myself an ambitious challenge to excite myself even more finish the app before may 1st when chloe and i would start preparing our move back to silicon valley to help start the human hacker house when i didn t want to be spending all my time working any more this would also get us launched before george s wedding on june 8th and before my twin brother s wedding on june 1st i calculated that scott and i would need to average thirteen hours a day between us to get it done in time at the thought of coding all out for four months my eyes narrowed my jaw jutted and i smiled a maniac smile let s see what i m capable of i remember this feeling well because i felt it as soon as i thought of doing this book watch for it when you re picking goals they should excite you through march and april i was averaging 9 04 hours a day every day my focus was higher than ever marred only by still too frequent email checking during code compilation pauses during one week i decided to see just how many hours i could do 87 3 89 it turns out not including three hours of hacking on quantified mind to help yoni out during that week we fixed 122 bugs built a ton of features and sent out five new builds scott matched me with seventy hours of his own and we blew all of our testers minds with the new features we d built during another week where my target was seventy hours i did a timelapse recording 90 of both my screen and my face both as a demonstration to my friends that i actually would do that much real work and as an aide to me to curb impulsiveness since i would look dumb if i pulled up beastskills com to look at clapping handstand pushup training advice or googled for the strongest dog it was easier than i thought though i was already in line with my destiny i overshot my quota of going out and being social five times a week did an average of 125 pull ups a day to even out my energy levels and was sweet to chloe 100 of days we did it by may 1 we d finished the app and submitted it to apple for review app store review usually takes a week and if they reject the app you change whatever they objected to resubmit and another week later you re live we conservatively estimated four weeks for review time but due to a thrilling app review adventure too frustrating to retell we were still stuck in a review queue four weeks later when i started this book project and went off for ten days of wedding travel everyone was frothing to know when we would launch including dozens of bloggers to whom i d sent prerelease copies and zillions of users and would be users whom i had long ago teased into a frenzy with months of posting near daily sneak peeks was i going to have to pull off the launch from the road while surrounded by family rehearsing my best man speeches partying with bachelors and keeping up with my book goals read on to the final chapter for the drawn out conclusion chapter eight learning anything what to learn motivation hackers can learn anything they say that anyone can learn anything but that s wishful thinking anyone could if he could bring himself to put in the time and effort but if he doesn t know how to make himself do that he can t learn his skill but the motivation hacker knows how to not only do the learning but to have fun doing it yes fun learning should make you smile not clench your teeth to hack motivation for learning you apply the motivation equation as with anything else use success spirals to increase expectancy learn something important to you in a fun way for high value avoid impulsiveness with precommitment especially the burnt ships technique and focus on the learning process rather than the end goal so that you can learn ten new words by tomorrow instead of being fluent in chinese in two years but the other critical component is to use good learning methods so that it s not only fun but that you also make rapid progress i ll tell you of how i learned 3 000 chinese words knife throwing skateboarding lucid dreaming public speaking long distance running and crossfit exercises during these three months as well as a technique that i used in the past to help learn spanish morse code braille biases and fallacies rational thinking techniques social skills anatomy investing cooking what food labels actually mean relevant phone and account numbers some famous poems and chess games how to deal with the police sensual massage and too many useless facts to mention as you build up your powers to learn anything you ll need to be more careful in what you choose to learn you ll have less of an ugh this sucks reaction to guide your studies and so you ll need to keep asking yourself is this worthwhile you need to be able to stop learning things when you realize they aren t useful or fun population and gdp ranking of every country while still never giving up on anything you do care about the raven since that hurts your success spiral a natural way to do this is to use short term goals which you must always reach but at which you can choose in advance to stop or re up a better way to do it is to use beeminder s one week delay in the ability to change your goal targets and sometimes you can continue your goal of spending x minutes learning daily while switching out what it is you re learning in the event of horrifying boredom 3 month projects during the writing of this book i wanted to learn things that were exciting useful and wouldn t take much total time the largest of these was chinese i figured that in thirty minutes a day using the new skritter chinese iphone app that i was about to launch i could learn to write 3 000 new words or one every fifty four seconds this included learning and remembering 95 of these words at any given time as well as reviewing all of the characters and words i already knew using its spaced repetition learning system more on spaced repetition later now i d already been learning chinese with skritter for years although not consistently and i knew how to write 2 605 characters and 4 268 multi character words i could learn much faster than a beginner it was time to broaden my vocabulary i decided so i put a goal of thirty three words per day on beeminder made a routine whereby i got to skritter in short chunks in fun places the park the hammock the papasan chair in bed as i fell asleep and stopped thinking about it the difficult learning was ahead but as far as my planning was concerned i was already done next skateboarding would be different not only did i not know how to skateboard but i had no idea how to learn to skateboard or whether it would be hard or where i would get a skateboard to begin i did my usual precommitment trick of mentioning everywhere that i was going to learn to skateboard this summer the usual lucky break happened my new housemate alex who like a santa dumbledore is always happy to share his millions of fascinating artifacts had a skateboard a longboard and an electric longboard 91 he told me i could borrow them anytime and hustled me out to the driveway to show me how to use them i could barely stand on the boards and when i turned the electric longboard to its slowest setting two miles per hour i fell off again and again this is going to be hard i thought i might have to spend more than ten minutes a day i did not think i might not be able to do this practice learning things exposes this for the absurdity that it is whether it s skateboarding or calculus the next day though i woke up at six in the morning carried the longboard down to the park while studying some chinese and then got ready for failboarding to my surprise i started cruising around right away exhilaration sage grin i was inefficient couldn t yet turn much and almost ran over some dogs but i knew this was going to be easy i would have to work on my technique with alex s help but that would come and eventually i d be able to go ten miles the hardest part would be to start saying longboard instead of skateboard which was hipness i knew not that morning i boarded back home into the sunrise and knew success next the story of knife throwing is the same as skateboarding i sucked and couldn t get it for the first week i mentioned this bemusement to my friend alton and he brought over dozens of better practice knives and showed me the technique better than i was getting from youtube videos within that day i was hitting 70 of the time with the bayonets from thirteen feet almost at my 80 goal already delightful when that knife thuds into the target zombie head there wells a giddy feeling of badassery why have i not done this before within four days i d already taught two house parties worth of people how to do the throw as if i was some expert and they also began to rock i knew that with five minutes of practice each morning as i got home from skateboarding i d be plenty awesome in three months and i set an informal goal of hitting at 80 from 28 feet instead next lucid dreaming where you realize you re dreaming and can control your dreams was another skill which i had always wanted to learn and which doesn t take much time i had known about it ever since i read about it on wikipedia in senior year of high school and that night went on to have my first lucid dream where i realized that if i was being whipped as a galley slave in a pirate ship which doesn t actually happen in real life then i must be dreaming and could do anything i wanted i smashed out of my chains supermanned up through the deck of the ship kicked the mast in half for good measure and then flew across the ocean to discover a mountain island filled with giants and the ruins of their gargantuan temples delighted i thought i might have such adventures every night but it wasn t that easy i only became lucid once every couple months i had limited control and often lapsed out of lucidity i d get too excited and wake up at the good parts and my dream recall sucked i forgot about deeper dream exploration and just switched between flying and sex in almost all of my lucid dreams even from my brief reading that first day i knew that lucid dreaming is a skill that just takes practice the same as any other skill and since most of the practice is done while you re asleep it doesn t even take extra time the value is high since the dreams are so much fun a great lucid dream can provide days of excitement delay is not too long since you can often start having lucid dreams the night after you read about them depending on routine impulsiveness might be high after waking when you should fill out your dream journal or throughout the day when you should do reality checks or as you re falling asleep when you should mentally condition yourself to have a lucid dream but for me those were not impulsive times i think i didn t have motivation to practice just because expectancy was too low lucid dreaming was harder than i had first guessed and so i had been discouraged when starting this project i knew what to do about my low expectancy read a book on lucid dreaming by someone who is great at it and writes as if it s easy then follow the author s advice to practice it how to books make things seem easier than they are which can kill motivation once you follow the advice half heartedly and then don t see any results but they re great for getting you started and if you actually do the things you re supposed to then you get the great results you were promised even though it s harder than the author made it out to be after all if he s writing a book on it then he probably had an easier time learning it than most people will 92 so i read lucid dreaming gateway to the inner self by robert waggoner skipped the precognition and shared dream chapters and had three lucid dreams in the first four nights involving wrestling centaurs teleportation morphing dream characters into other people and asking dream figures for advice i started narrating my dreams using my phone s dictation feature every morning after i woke up and my dream recall increased from less than one a night to 1 9 a night with vivid detail instead of confusing plot holes i started doing a reality check of smiling and shooting awesome rays from my eyes at things throughout each day i started mentally affirming that i was about to have a lucid dream as i went to sleep and visualizing previous dreams but with lucidity cues whenever i woke up during the night i set dream missions for myself so that instead of flying i could ask inventor elon musk 93 for great insights on the future of science and direct extra muscle construction nutrients toward my pecs this is a good strategy for learning many things 1 get excited about a skill 2 while you re excited make time and hack up motivation to practice it 3 learn how to practice it from reading or from a teacher 4 start doing it right away it s simple if you don t skip any of these obvious steps if you do skip steps like setting aside time designing a motivating environment or starting now as opposed to the dread later then it s hard if your schedule is already full then you might need to save the goal for later you ll then need a trigger something with enough spark to start a goal that you ve grown accustomed to putting off my trigger for improving my public speaking came when i realized that i would have to give two best man speeches and a meetup talk in june each to more than a hundred people my previous public speaking style with much smaller audiences was it s not important so just wing it i had no problem starting now reading several articles and making time to practice when i needed to be good at it right away you can often manufacture this type of trigger sign up to do something you don t know how to do in the hyperbolically discounted not so scary future when the time comes you ll have to learn it you re sending your future self a motivation bomb i did this with my marathon training i had always wanted to be able to run without stopping but i had never put in the time i had thought of myself as fit and fast but after i had to run five miles down a mountain to make a skritter meeting for which i had mixed up my time zones i realized not only that this was the furthest that i d ever run but also that i was not fit fast or able to move afterward when i started this book two weeks later i said at the end of these three months i will run a marathon my human hacker housemate janet a former ironman triathlete and national level competitive speed skater agreed to coach me i registered for the race and a 5k too why not wrote it into my book and told everyone i would do it this was all easy since i figured that the hard training would be weeks away and i d deal with it when i got to it nope janet had other plans here is your thirteen week training plan you want to train for a marathon from scratch in three months which is too short you also want to drop your 5k time by five minutes and increase your bench press by sixty pounds and you only want to train for eight hours a week and you don t want to get injured and you don t want to be too tired to work this is unrealistic so you will have to train in intense bursts of many different exercises to do it you need to go to the 6 30am crossfit classes at planet granite buy better running shoes and a jump rope learn twenty five new exercises and unlearn nine exercises that you learned wrong including your running you look like a penguin with that much left right pivoting you need to sleep more eat better and do thirteen pain free stretches 94 each day i will teach you you start today longboard two miles to sports basement buy running shoes and run back so much for easing into it at least i committed before i knew what i was getting into it is not easy for me to learn new movements of the few lifts i had been doing the previous fall squat deadlift press and pull up only my pull up had good form the rest i d thought i was good at but it turns out my form was bad enough that i was using the wrong muscle groups learning from books and videos was not working so the coaching was essential even with knife throwing and skateboarding i was literally starting off on the wrong foot until someone corrected me in person and of all the training plans i had devised in the past only one worked well past the initial gains the crazy hundreds of pull ups a day routine 95 suggested by yoni another human hacker housemate i say that i m confident i can learn anything but that process includes finding people to teach me for things that i don t pick up easily i didn t need a public speaking coach or a lucid dreaming coach and i can learn cooking from books but i bet my handstands would be a lot better right now if i hadn t been training solo this whole time another thing i had to learn was how to write a book the longest thing i had ever written was a sixteen page college paper for my honors thesis and that took weeks and didn t have to be readable by anyone how would i write an interesting book with 50 100 pages in three months while enjoying the process the day before i started writing i spent three hours reading a few writers blog posts and hitting all of the highest rated topic threads at writers stackexchange com then i bought four books on writing that would kick off my read twenty books goal and committed to spending no more time reading writing blogs until i was done with the first draft the process seemed simple enough make a great writing environment plan what you ll write first write a target number of words of it every day and don t show anyone or edit until you re done with the terrible first draft then when editing there were many specific tactics for rewriting it to be good most of which distill to using a few good words instead of many mediocre ones sure i can write a thousand crappy words in a couple hours each day then i ll cut out 30 of them and it ll be brilliant i determined that there wasn t much conscious practice that i needed to do since the advice was all to stifle the conscious impulse to edit while writing all the hard practice would come later many writers first timers or not talk about crushing self doubt when writing that must suck writing is hard enough i enjoyed it with limitless confidence even without hardly any of the practice that everyone recommends i m not saying that i wrote a great book and that i m a good writer just that i knew that i would finish and then i would edit and re edit and that nothing would stop me i couldn t guarantee quality or readership just excitement throughout the process a lot of people want to be writers but don t want to write they are seeking prestige on a borrowed goal i wondered if this was true for me i did remember that i enjoyed writing bad poetry back in high school writer s workshop and i noticed some very high happiness pings while i spent a day writing all of the launch announcements for skritter which made me think that it would be a good goal when i continued to measure high happiness levels every time i caught myself writing this book i knew it was real writing rocks anki if you want to learn facts then you should use a spaced repetition system srs you break knowledge you want to acquire into short answers to tiny questions and then you make digital flashcards of those in an srs program which will then prompt you to review them at the most efficient time for strengthening your memories right before you were in danger of forgetting them you learn fast you remember almost everything and it s easy to turn into a daily habit that can deliver massive piles of knowledge in a few minutes a day say you re learning spanish now not everything of learning spanish should be learned as a fact with an srs your pronunciation will best improve from actual conversation and you ll want to read and write longer pieces to get context for the words you re learning but part of learning any language is learning a lot of vocabulary and srs makes vocabulary learning easy you put in the time each day and you get a big vocabulary i bring up srs not only because it s a great way to learn facts and because learning facts is a large part of many goals but also because it s easy to hack motivation with an srs srs programs give you daily stats on how much progress you re making how much time you re spending how many reviews you need to do to stay on track and how well you re remembering what you ve learned it s trivial to set measured goals for yourself whether it s in beeminder or not whether you re aiming to learn x items per day or spend y minutes studying there s no delay since you get to learn useful information every day with many srs programs now being mobile apps it s often easy to make time to do some reviews wherever you are when impulsiveness is lowest commuting waiting for people after breakfast expectancy will be high as long as you start slow you ll automatically get great progress and start a success spiral of steady progress since there aren t many reviews to do at first and if you pick what you want to learn well then the value of what you re learning will be clear and doing the reviews can even be fun if you re wondering what srs program to use you should choose anki which is a free desktop app web service and android app with a 24 99 iphone app its flashcard system is versatile enough that you can learn just about any facts with it i ve used it to learn many things including spanish cooking and sensual massage to learn skills like sensual massage it helps to think of the question as the cue of what just happened and the answer as what to do next q second half of chest circulation after pressing up to the neck a lightly press back down the sides to the abdomen i ve also used anki to start learning many things which turned out to be useless which i then deleted like extensive geographical details on every country in the world that s the first mistake to avoid with srs learning don t learn things which are not valuable to you if you are learning chinese or japanese then you should use my startup s app skritter instead since it s better than anki you don t have to make your own flashcards you just tell it what textbooks or words you want to learn and it makes them for you with richer prompts than you could do with anki this highlights the second mistake of srs learning don t spend more time encoding and studying a fact than it will save you if it takes a minute to make a flashcard and two minutes to learn it for life then you should only learn things that will eventually save you more than three minutes of looking them up if as is average on skritter it takes just fifty four seconds to learn an item then you can profitably learn anything that will save you more than fifty four seconds which is any chinese or japanese word that you expect to encounter a few times depending on your speed with a dictionary there are eighteen more classic srs mistakes which you should avoid read about them and how to formulate srs prompts on the supermemo site 96 but the biggest mistake is not listed there it has killed more srs study habits than all the others combined and it will kill yours too if you don t hack it it happens when you get behind on your studies and get buried under a mountain of all your overdue reviews because an srs program models the actual strength of memories in your mind which decay over time it doesn t get to control when those memory items become due for review they re due when you re about 10 likely to forget them if you go on vacation or forget about your reviews or pause your studies when some big project looms then those due reviews keep building up instead of spending fifteen minutes to review 200 old items and learn twenty new ones the fun part you spend fifteen minutes to review 240 old items from a week ago and then another fifteen minutes for the next 240 old ones from six days ago and another fifteen minutes and another fifteen you ve studied for an hour you re still not caught up and you didn t get to learn anything new and you forgot more of those overdue items than usual too you eventually push through it and get back on track but it wasn t any fun the next time it happens you ve learned to dread the overdue review mountain sooner or later you ll give up rather than climb it your srs habit will die and you ll lose all the knowledge you had so efficiently memorized this is unfortunate because it s all in your head each review you do strengthens your total knowledge learning isn t just adding new items the number of reviews due is a guideline for you not something you re graded on and doing overdue reviews is often slightly more efficient than doing them on time just a little more frustrating 97 yet if you are human you will naturally get behind and then stress out about being behind the motivation hacker will not let this happen instead she will focus her expectancy on the process spend an average of fifteen minutes per day on anki she ll structure her goal to be strict enough to keep herself on track and flexible enough to achieve while still having a life beemind it she ll build up her success spiral slowly so she doesn t fall off make sure she s setting aside time to study and keep an eye on what she s learning to make sure that it actually matters to her instead of realizing too late that she s added too many useless facts and when she does spend six days meditating in a monastery with no chance to study she ll over review beforehand and consistently review afterward not paying much attention to the due reviews and before you know it without hardly trying she ll know russian american sign language human neuroanatomy a thousand jokes all useful account and telephone numbers a poem for every occasion a big picture history of the world and enough machine learning techniques to teach a robot kung fu chapter nine task samurai dwarf dishes aren t you going to shower i just showered what really but you just that was fast this conversation is as reliable as a fine after a how are you with every test subject who has witnessed one of my speed showers i often shower lazily lost in thought for fifteen minutes but sometimes i ve got something to do and i want to shower quickly so i can go do it telling myself to shower quickly leads only to daydreaming making it a challenge to see how fast i can shower however leads to glory my best shower time used

can spend your energies on things that matter if you don t have a system or if your system does not work as described then you need a new system there are no shortage of long books and short blog

development nerdy productivity coveys time management matrix illustrated with xkcd comics if you have a good system and it s still not working because you don t follow it then build a success spiral around it take almost every task out of it and then always do the remaining tasks as you get more consistent slowly add more tasks to that system if they re worth doing tend your success spiral carefully and eventually you will be able to do arbitrarily many tasks without furrowing your brow in despair or even annoyance once tasks afford only accomplishing and never putting off you don t have to spend any of your motivation on running your life the fool s defense another good strategy for defeating valueless tasks is to not do them sometimes this is easy but not always one strategy discussed earlier is trading icky tasks to people in exchange for tasks where you have a comparative advantage another strategy is to batch these tasks and do them less often like sending mail buying and preparing food or having meetings a third is to pay other people to do them friends personal assistants virtual assistants etc you can often trade money for time and the trade makes more sense when the time would be grudgingly spent a fourth strategy is the fool s defense you signal your inability to perform a task in the hopes that someone else will then take care of it for you an example defender is the professor randy pausch who refused to learn to use the copy machine so his secretary would never expect him to make his own copies this is okay since his secretary gets paid to do things he can t do another example which is perhaps not so moral is that of the mathematician who pretended to be unable to perform basic tasks such as doing laundry cooking food remembering appointments or even finding his own apartment so that his wife would exasperatedly do all of these things for him and he could have more time to spend on math in reality he was unfairly imposing on his wife since he did know how to do these things but that s what he had to sacrifice for his art i won t go into the ethics of mooching or the game theory of signaling inability as a substitute for negotiating the trading of tasks those are things you ll have to decide for yourself but note that you probably already do this already whether you have your girlfriend crush spiders for you or whether your roommate has to fix the wifi when the router acts up if you re comfortable feigning helplessness ironing shirts then you might consider developing a reputation of never answering emails you d save time and focus for more important things and people would learn to deal with your eccentricity chapter ten experiments measure your results entrepreneurs management gurus and scientists all like to quote other entrepreneurs management gurus and scientists saying things like you make what you measure 98 what gets measured gets managed 99 and if you cannot measure it you cannot improve it 100 there s now a community called quantified self 101 which extends that idea to personal measurement for personal improvement if you want to save money you should track your spending if you want to get stronger it helps to track your workout performance and if you want to improve your motivation your focus your happiness or your productivity then you should measure those things because otherwise you won t know what s working you say i know what works for me perhaps you do most of us don t though kahneman s evidence 102 shows that we suck at remembering and predicting our own well being we as a culture still ignore this empirical evidence recommending to live our lives so as to avoid deathbed regrets 103 deathbed regrets are like hollywood films they stir passions for a couple hours but are poorly connected to reality they are not good criteria for a well lived life and it s not just in the realm of happiness where we are blind and claim to see whether it s success in business fitness diet relationships health or productivity there s a fad for that the degree to which the next fad leaves us more successful than the last fad combined with how contradictory the two are shows how much truth fads contain not much most of a fad s contents are a sticky mixture of stories that sound good enough for us to believe them there s a little bit of truth in each fad but without struggling to carve out that truth from its sticky story goo we ll be stuck switching fads altogether instead of preserving what worked from the last attempt and the parts that work are different for different people you can t trust anyone else to seek this truth for you if you want to improve you can do it in two ways the first is what everyone does try something and then decide whether it was worthwhile based on remembering self hunches or skipping the evaluation altogether and calling sour grapes if you failed sweet grapes if you succeeded why of course it was worthwhile to learn the guitar compete in a triathlon have kids travel the world and that unfinished movie script well it must not have been fulfilling or you would have finished it right we tend to pick a destination arrive somewhere else and then be thankful we ended up precisely where we did unaware of all the other places we could have gone and more importantly the other paths we could have traveled this automatic contentment instinct comes in handy since it keeps us at a baseline level of well being 104 most of the time but if we want to surpass the baseline well being to which all our instincts strive to return us we must seek the truth of what fulfills us more than average if you re extraordinarily talented at introspection you might be able to just meditate your way to an understanding of this but the rest of us must use science enter the self experimenter the self experimenter improves by determining what works with simple experiments for example i wanted to improve my skin but i didn t know what interventions would actually help i started using facial cleanser on just one half of my face body wash on just one half of my body tracking when i showered and changed my sheets and alternating weeks of wearing a clean t shirt to bed i then asked chloe to help me count my zits each day without telling her which half was which i analyzed the data and saw that body wash p 0 04 and facial cleanser p 0 02 both helped a tiny amount washing the sheets did nothing wearing a t shirt did nothing missing a day of showering did nothing and missing multiple days of showering might have hurt a little bit these results overrule many of my intuitions and now i can save time not messing around with interventions that don t work and move on to testing some that might whatever goals you pick you should have some way of measuring the results many goals are intended to make you happier so measure your happiness and see what is effective if you re trying to get stronger then measure how much stronger you re getting with each protocol you try so you can determine what s working trying to lose weight decide in advance how long you re going to try eating according to a nutritional philosophy what the cutoff would be for much weight and body fat you would need to lose for it to be successful do it for that long then quit if it s not working or continue if it is be a scientist about it a little rigor goes far the curiosity involved in running an experiment can help motivation too now your reward is not just lowering stress for a month but also discovering how to lower it again in the future if you re as geeky as me there can be as much value in finding this truth as in the short term result itself if you re like me and don t mind measuring lots of things you can start to re use measurements across different areas of your life to answer more questions i can see that i feel healthier when i shower more that i sleep better when i eat less and that listening to music has no effect on my cognitive performance despite the huge effect on my mood almost half of scientific discoveries happen by chance 105 if you measure only the most obvious possible result of pursuing your goals you miss out on many of the truths that could surprise you chapter eleven mistakes the planning fallacy when hacking motivation failure is expensive in terms of time coins since you have to rebuild a lot of damaged expectancy but if you haven t had practice hacking motivation then how do you avoid failure while attempting things you ve never done before avoid these common mistakes as if your dreams depend on it the most common mistake is to fall prey to the planning fallacy 106 when setting up your success spirals when humans estimate things like how long a task will take their average case and best case predictions are almost identical and their worst case prediction is still more optimistic than what actually happens when you set up your success spiral the planning fallacy will mess you up because you ll think how often will i exercise oh five times a week sounds doable i ll start there then life happens you catch a cold a work project demands extra time a birthday anniversary holiday vacation date thing comes up the gym closes early on sundays you drink too much one night before you know it you re toast and your success spiral cracks you can t predict in advance what specific obstacles are going to batter you away from the gym so you don t plan for any of them but you should plan that something will make it harder than you can expect a good hack is to take the outside view ask yourself how long did it take last time or how often did i work out last time plan for the worst and hope for the best start your success spirals small enough so that you re guaranteed to win even if everything goes wrong when i was starting success spirals i thought i could average twenty minutes of anki practice a day i thought of the planning fallacy and cut that in half for a conservative estimate and then performed a hofstadter adjustment 107 and set my success spiral goal for five minutes a day i hoped i would do more than five minutes and i usually did but when life became a jungle with no room for civilized pursuits i could hang on and do five minutes no matter how much i just wanted to sleep success spiral saved you can even set goals like do at least ten seconds of journaling six out of seven days i m near my computer you ll hope to write 750 words 108 a day but you ll plan for chaos and when it happens you won t get discouraged and quit writing you ll still build a great habit underhacked motivation another way that overconfidence manifests itself is in how much motivation you decide to muster for a particular goal in particular you ll tend to not use enough motivation hacks you ll think i already run sometimes without even pushing myself if i set a schedule to run three times a week and i tell a friend that i m doing it it ll be easy such optimism is human and must be fought set up more motivation hacks than you can ever imagine needing i can t count how many times i ve told myself i could do something without needing to get too strict about it only to rationalize quitting or postponing when the going gets tough neither can i count all the times that i ve heard other people object to committing to a goal reasoning that they shouldn t have to force themselves to do something that they want to do they then come up with a single clever trick from a book they just read a silver bullet that they ll fire into the head of akrasia zombie 109 the next time he shambles up i don t know about you but if i m going to face a zombie especially one that ate me last time i played i m going to want more than one bullet and i m going to want to fire them from range instead of waiting until he s within brain smelling distance i m going to hack motivation way more than i expect i ll need to and i m going to do it up front when i m feeling most excited about my goal i ll precommit i ll burn ships i ll create a motivation only environment i ll start self tracking to keep myself honest i ll find ways to make it more fun and i ll precommit some more i might only need one bullet to achieve my goal but if i fire off fifty rounds in every possible zombie hiding spot while the sun is still up i m not only more likely to survive and win the goal but i m also going to have a lot more fun along the way knowing that nothing can stop me it s not fun to force yourself to work towards your goals don t rely on willpower don t fall prey to overconfidence and don t think that overbuilding your motivation structure somehow means that you re incapable of doing what you want to and should be able to do naturally once you have the success spiral of richard feynman or tim ferriss or michael jordan you can skip the beeminder and just do it until then realize that everyone you see shining with competence and productivity either built great habits over a long period of time or has a mess of dirty dishes and buried insecurities hidden behind the rippling abs unambitious goals i ve said it before in chapter 6 but i ll say it again in case you missed it avoid running after the wrong goals the motivation hacker learns to run fast and if he goes the wrong way he ll end up far from the life he wanted and if he makes himself excel at something he doesn t like he ll override the natural pain indicators and push until he hurts himself always accomplish what you set out to do but stop after any milestone where you realized that you weren t enjoying the journey don t make the mistake of picking goals that don t excite you practice on some easy stuff sure but then use these motivation hacking techniques to amaze yourself do something crazy it s much easier to do something hard and exciting than to do something easy that you merely probably should eat 100 paleo for a month is easier than eat vegetables twenty times and eat processed food only four times because it s more exciting both of those goals are specific immediate and mostly approach oriented but the second may not be challenging enough this is easy to mess up if you don t explicitly follow dr steel s csi approach setting challenging specific immediate approach oriented goals eat more paleo 110 for a month is not specific enough eat only vegetables this month is too challenging and eat vegetables once a week is not challenging eat 100 paleo has time problems starting and stopping when don t eat modern foods this month is okay but it s less helpful in telling you what to eat and it feels less noble to avoid eating bad food than to eat only good food sometimes people are afraid to be specific about a goal because they re not sure what they want or what they ll be able to accomplish what if they commit to the wrong goal but without a plan they re not likely to succeed they should plan as well as they can and then set a time limit on the goal so that if it turns out to not be worthwhile at least they can stop afterward stopping after you reach a goal is better than stopping before you start during your pursuit or never chapter twelve list of motivation techniques sources the major motivation hacking techniques i use success spirals precommitment burnt ships and being a task samurai are all recommended in many places including piers steel s book the procrastination equation which details the motivation equation and dozens of clever research experiments used to develop it look there for more details and supporting science steel also suggests many other motivation hacking techniques most of which i have tried and found less useful for me personally some of them may work for you though so i ll briefly list them here in case you re looking for extra hacks i prefer to focus on achieving superhuman motivation instead of avoiding normal human procrastination every motivation hack i suggest anecdotally in this book is backed up empirically in steel s except for the ideas of summoning vast motivation surpluses to burn as fuel for max fun and of riding success spirals to the stars the motivation hacker will realize that she needn t stop at getting in shape and quitting an email addiction she will catch old dreams discover new ones and do anything she pleases expectancy recall that expectancy is your confidence of success these techniques increase motivation by making you certain that you ll succeed success spirals set yourself a series of achievable goals and then achieve all of them until you expect only success and failure is no longer familiar vicarious victory surround yourself with motivated people and avoid unmotivated people to have their motivation rub off on you if you can t change your friends reading biographies of inspirational people is an easier example of this mental contrasting visualize the success you want to achieve then contrast it with the not success you have now if you skip the contrasting step it may be worse than nothing 111 add in implementation intentions 112 and process visualization 113 for more oomph guarding against excessive optimism we all fall prey to the planning fallacy this often destroys success spirals when planning paths toward goals you can expect the best but plan for the worst so that you can still avoid failure even when everything goes wrong value value is both how rewarding a task will be when you finish it and how fun it is while you re doing it these are general ways to adjust what you re doing so that it s more meaningful and fun find flow tasks which are too easy or too hard are not engaging so find ways to make tasks challenging but possible i think of this in terms of being a task samurai and doing dwarf dishes make a game of it compete against yourself or against others find meaning look for ways to connect tasks with major life goals so that you can remind yourself why you re doing what you re doing set up extra reminders of these connections where you ll see them set csi approach goals smart goals are out and challenging specific immediate and approach not avoidance goals are in these goals should excite you the challenging and approach bits the specific and immediate bits help with impulsiveness making sure you know what you need to do at any time i find that input goals study ten minutes daily tend to work better than output goals learn ten words daily optimize energy everything is more fun if you re alert not tired sleep well eat well get fit guard your circadian rhythms and avoid burnout cure energy lows with quality breaks movement sunshine and good music match intensive tasks with periods of high energy productive procrastination if you can t bring yourself to do your main task at least get some other things out of the way it s not perfect but perfect is the enemy of good create rewards when you succeed celebrate it either by congratulating yourself or giving yourself a treat treats can backfire if overused though i prefer victory dances fist pumps and grinning like an idiot focus on passion know what you re passionate about and steer your life towards those passions ask if your common tasks are connected to passion ask if they re intrinsically motivating task trading this one isn t backed up by any research that i know about but it makes economic sense and i love it trade tasks according to comparative motivational advantage so that each person is doing the tasks which motivates her more impulsiveness impulsiveness is your susceptibility to delay for a given task how likely you are to put it off and do something more pressing limiting impulsiveness often means getting rid of the options to do other things precommitment choose now to limit your later options preventing yourself from making the wrong choice in the face of temptation burnt ships a specific form of precommitment where you disable remove or destroy a distraction or temptation goal reminders make external reminders of your goals visible and actually look at them avoid failing at your goals just because you forgot about them timeboxing place limits on the time allowed to perform a given task the shorter the better it s easier to ignore distractions when you know you can t finish your task if you give into them and that you only have to focus on your task for a short time build useful habits make an autopilot schedule for yourself and put your goals into it or add goals to existing routines schedule play before work plan times to have as much fun as you can this leads to more efficient recreation and it also lets you focus on your goals during the other times rather than just having low grade leisure constantly tempting you as an option play hard delay delay is how far off the reward seems to be this is often hard to manipulate directly but sometimes you can set yourself up to perceive delay differently thus scoring a big motivation win break goals down granularize big goals until the next achievement is right in front of you subgoals and sub subgoals defeat delay this is what beeminder does automatically you get a target for each day plan fallaciously this isn t so much a technique as a phenomenon and its effects on motivation aren t backed up by any research either just my experience with my startup and marathon training the planning fallacy automatically gives you more courage to start by underestimating the time and effort required to achieve many unknown hard goals i think this is a good thing as long as your goals are input based and not output based

motivation hacker missions skydiving jump out of a plane while screaming in terror when she jumped out of the plane right before me chloe made the loudest scream that her tandem skydiving instructor had ever heard she kept her eyes closed during freefall in the video it looks as if she s sleeping despite this terror she had a big smile once on the ground a classic skydiving success story of facing one s fear of heights my over pre commitment strategy worked i was cool and confident until i jumped everyone told me that the initial leap is the only scary part and then it s fun and surprisingly peaceful i see now that this is like what you might tell a child in order to pierce it with a gigantic bone marrow needle i guess it was fun but at the time i couldn t decide whether to pass out or throw up i think it was the indecision that saved me long enough to get to the ground skydiving instructors pointing and laughing now there s a face that says you had fun me white as a bone with all its marrow extracted nnnguhhh chloe running over to me oh my god nick you re so white me if i were in a movie my tan hasn t landed yet me not actually james bond how you i jumped big loud throw up mmm hold me i did the scary thing and gained more confidence but i won t go outdoor skydiving again too much driving it takes two hours to get there and not enough action less than a minute make for low fun density lucid dreaming increase lucid dreaming and achieve three fantastic dream missions while wrangling with a slippery pull up bar in a hobbit sized bright green doorway to the woodshop in my ancestral spawning grounds in minnesota i thought to myself why am i trying to put this pull up bar in the rochester house this is probably a dream i should do something else the dream started to go away so i tried to focus on the nail hole in the bright green doorframe and after a few seconds the dream congealed once more allowing me to move on with my lucid mission i decided to teleport to some place with a view i found myself at dad s place in salt lake city up on the mountains looking across the valley i was tempted to fly over the valley but instead i took up an insane rifle of gratuitous power and sniped a bullet over to the mountains on the far side fifty miles away except i was the bullet and i flew in seconds to the other side with the city and lake whizzing below me thinking about how awesome this was i decided to bullet fly further and i flew around the world a few times in a second this was too fast for me to notice anything then i decided it would be awesome to burrow fly through the earth so i flew up and then shot down into the ground in the valley i flew through the dirt for a while like some superhero mole although i didn t get too much sensory impression during this then i shot up inside an absurdly fancy building where some rich people were having one of those parties you only see in movies where everyone is ignoring a bunch of guys in tuxedos playing chamber music and there are two white marble staircases per capita i burst through the floor and everyone gaped i didn t stick around but instead flew through the ceiling overwhelmingly pleased with myself already for having such a great lucid dream and for puncturing the posh party it was nighttime when i broke through the roof of this glorious salt lake city cathedral temple tabernacle thing and there was a fatty moon in the sky i thought hey i could teleport over there and explore the moon but then i decided against it because i feared that sudden teleportation might wake me up what would be cooler would be to haul the moon to earth then i would have dream continuity and i would get the moon i started hauling the moon down to myself as if i were pulling it on an invisible moonrope and it lurched closer and closer and loomed larger and larger eventually it was half a mile across and floating above the suicidal skateboarder slaying hill up to dad s house i hovered up above some parked cars then charged up and flew at the moon i smashed through and overshot by a mile mummified in moon dust i looked back to see the damage the moon had split into one big piece and a bunch of pulverized debris and when i looked it did that nuclear explosion vortexing a space planet thing with the flat radial pressure wave where i hit it moon destroyed high five bro i started to worry that since this lucid dream was being so long and detailed i would start to forget it if i kept going so instead of trying to become a planet i decided to go home and go to bed to end the dream on the inexplicably short walk home i reviewed what had happened in the dream so far so i d remember then i was in my bedroom in the human hacker house and chloe was there sleeping i suddenly wasn t sure if i was still dreaming since this was so mundane so i decided to do my reality check smile at something and shoot awesome rays at it in this case i smiled and shot awesome rays at chloe who started glowing with brilliant power and she stirred and woke up yes still dreaming satisfied i went to lucid sleep and woke up the rest of that morning was glorious if only i could start every day so adventurously my dream recall hit 1 9 per night and after reading the lucid dreaming book and starting to practice i averaged one lucid dream per week in periods where i thought about lucid dreaming more i had more lucid dreams this is a case where the continual reminder to direct attention toward my goal made it happen in addition to the above dream here is a list of lucid dream missions accomplished during the project not counting non lucid dreams where i rampaged as a dinosaur defeated the greatest swordsman in the land and stopped a nuclear explosion flying three times sex three times teleporting successfully once and unsuccessfully once giving chloe radiant glowing power through awesome rays from my eyes twice using awesome rays on a toilet talking to paul graham semi successfully turning into a dragon unsuccessful paralyzing a witch to save hermione 115 wrestling a centaur morphing dream characters into other people and asking dream figures for subconscious answers to life questions my dreams never used to be this cool i had set my success criteria as doing three missions and i blew past that after the project i m going to keep practicing lucid dreaming i talked to my friend ben reitz the dream master and he added even more ideas for my list of things to do in lucid dreams which now consists of becoming a bear 116 engaging in supernatural combat exploring other planets becoming a planet being a sorcerer riding a dragon talking to dead people relatives famous scientists berserk dictators working through problems with einstein creating my own animals using primordial energy from my hands sending healing energy to afflicted parts of my body ritualistically shedding burdens hypnotizing my waking self in self improving ways being an opposite gender practicing chinese seeking transcendental enlightenment discovering my totemic dream animal doing the most amazing dance the universe has ever seen witnessing the big bang composing music burping so loudly that i destroy the sun 117 discovering mysteries at the bottom of the vasty deep experiencing life in four or two dimensions having a conversation with a copy of myself seeing what i ll look like in twenty years seeing colors i ve never seen before practicing parkour being in two places at once generating amazing startup ideas pulling my dream self out of a mirror diving into the sun swimming with dolphins mixing senses so as to taste colors being inside a cartoon transmogrifying into a cloud and raining down running faster than sound stepping through mirrors stopping time flying with wings traveling to another dimension building a dream workshop that has doors through which i can enter continuous dream environments like my science lab or my continuing adventure knife throwing hit a target from 13 80 of the time average daily practice time 5 minutes people i taught how to throw 30 goal hit rate from 13 feet 80 actual hit rate from 13 feet 90 best streak from 13 feet 41 in a row hit rate from 28 feet 50 knives mysteriously vanished 3 knives thrown over the west fence 40 times i jumped over the west fence 40 arrows shot over the northwest fence 1 sandlot beast dogs over the northwest fence 2 times i jumped over the northwest fence 0 118 cabbages accidentally destroyed 6 throwing knives is so much fun it s no wonder that it s the most popular american pastime with the average person throwing for nearly five hours a day if only but it s almost as hard to understand why people do not throw knives as it is to understand why they watch so much tv everyone who tried it was able to do it and all but one of them enjoyed it it was easier than i expected to hit my accuracy goal after alton taught me the basic technique before that i spent a week getting nowhere with youtube videos and too small knives on the last day when i went to test my final accuracy i made a video 119 of myself throwing from the 28 foot distance to make it more fun i taped my phone onto the target to record the throws it took me several takes and i almost pierced the phone a couple times but i got it i then invented longboard knifethrowing where you ride your longboard past three targets as you try to hit each one with a knife it s like yabusame the traditional japanese art of mounted archery except for real people 120 awesome right this is going to blow up let me tell you everyone will be doing it longboarding be able to travel 10 miles on a longboard because i had originally wanted to longboard as a way of getting around that wasn t walking or biking i set my goal as longboarding for ten miles to that end i learned both goofy and regular footing from the start so that i d be able to switch between the two and have more endurance even after the first month when i was able to go for short rides and not torpedo the board into the street every two minutes i still couldn t go very far before the shin or calf from some 90 year old man would teleport into my leg displace my youthful tissue twang in exhausted pain and force me to limp home not good enough so i switched out my beloved vibram toe shoes for icky running shoes fixed my knee bending and foot pumping action with coaching from skatemaster alex and kept practicing i also taught two friends longboarding is harder than knife throwing but i never fell i think this means i wasn t training hard enough a week before the final test i took the electric longboard on most of the route i would ride if there is a mode of ground transportation more fun than this i do not know it i felt like the coolest human it goes up to twenty miles per hour which is sick fast for something with brakes like soggy gum i also learned the answer to the eternal question of whether i can jump out of a moving vehicle and just run double fast without falling over not if it s going a whit faster than twenty miles per hour whew the ten mile mission was a success i took it easy and averaged six miles per hour including waiting on traffic lights walking it past double wide pedestrians and climbing 300 feet i m not a great longboarder yet but i can get around and have fun and i can switch my feet while riding this is sufficiently rad writing a book write a complete first draft of this book about motivation hacking my strategy of beeminding a thousand word a day writing goal with 7290 on the line if i fell off track worked too well i finished the first draft of everything except this last chapter after five weeks of writing realized my book was going to be a short one paused my beeminder and sat around picking at the editing while wishing i had more writing to do my daily routine unraveled a bit once it lost the morning writing session and my average happiness was 0 5 points lower without it i need to create more writing projects for myself i love writing when i was a kid my parents provided two examples artistic writer mom and computer engineer dad mom look i have painted a phoenix girl let us go to my photography showing and then the repertory theater play afterward we shall play boggle with cathy and spawn dragons from fimo clay my egg horror poem is going to be in a 9th grade literature textbook dad i am ahead on all my ibm asic 121 timing projects and have just pruned the apple trees wanna play apple baseball or construct rockets from tinfoil and match heads after you finish your math homework i ll write a perl program to generate all possible solutions both parents were happy both paths were attractive and both talents seemed if not things i had then things i could reach for but it seemed as if you couldn t do both as if you had to be either creative or logical artistic or scientific into books or into computers i don t know where i got this idea for a while i wasn t into anything constructive in senior year of high school it was all about writer s workshop with mr mahle 122 in college i was pulled to and fro by the latest fascinating classes ending up with the computer scientists and letting creative writing go i got serious about writing code and forgot about writing anything else while i did my startup my choice was made that was silly why give up something i love i may not be able to make a living doing two things at once but from motivation hacking i ve learned that i don t need to make a living from something to spend hours a day doing it never again will i tell parts of myself i don t have time for you i now know how to make time and for the mission how did the book turn out let me know nick skritter com learning 3 000 chinese words go from 4 268 word writings learned in skritter to 7 268 three months ago i knew how to write 4 268 chinese words comprised of 2 605 different characters now forty one hours of study later at twenty seven minutes per day i ve learned 3 005 new words and 353 new characters with a 91 7 retention rate i ve still got a lot to learn but this is a big step for my written chinese for reference the highest level of the old too hard chinese proficiency test required 3 109 characters and 8 619 words counting literacy by vocabulary size is like dating based on physical attractiveness you re eating the shallow crust of a deep pie but it s tasty and everyone does it it s not as if my next book is going to be in chinese or anything but maybe the one after that will be as predictable as this mission was there were two surprises the first is that learning so many characters in a row made me so good at it that i freaked myself out normally in chinese you can t tell how to write a character you ve never seen even if you know what it sounds like and what it means you get some faint clues but it would be like guessing the medical name for cheese poisoning is tyrotoxism here s an example there s a character pronounced yǎng which means to itch how do you write it why 痒 of course the sickness radical 疒 plus it kind of sounds like 羊 yáng sheep i guessed and wrote this character in three seconds and was on to the next prompt before i realized that i d never seen it before this was way better than my normal mode of infrequent learning where each new character was a mystery the second surprising thing was how dependent i was on beeminder to get me studying i ve tried to ramp up my chinese self study several times before each attempt whimpered off here is my beeminder graph of word writings learned the points which hug the bottom of the line are days where i would have failed my goal if i didn t learn some more words by the end of the day i commanded beeminder to command me to study and so i studied it wasn t painful i enjoyed the studying but i just wouldn t study enough without help there s one bump in the beginning of august where i motivated myself to get ahead but it didn t last reading twenty books read twenty fiction and non fiction books on my reading list the beeminder graph for reading twenty books looks similar to the 3 000 chinese words graph except there are about ten places where i jumped way above the line that s what happens when i couldn t stop reading a great book so about half the books fascinated me sounds right to see the graph and the list of books i read check out http www nickwinter net the motivation hacker missions was reading a book every 4 5 days as rewarding as i d hoped yes and more the summer feels richer for the ideas and stories that filled it i gave up early on four books that i didn t like and i never do that awareness of my purpose in reading helped me say no to boring books i also had to trisect my favorite cryptonomicon with two shorter books in order to stay alive on beeminder 1168 pages i love it but next time i set a book reading goal i ll make it time based reading books in parallel with my goals inspired me books on writing motivation willpower and lucid dreaming hit the spot less obviously but perhaps more helpful were the tales of science fiction adventure which reminded me to dare mighty things 123 for my next tech startup public speaking learn public speaking and pull off two great best man speeches the first best man speech was for my twin brother zach zach is a handsome friendly guy who will fly across the country for a deal on a souped up miata you want to buy drive it a hundred miles per hour back home help you put another hundred horsepower into it and then study for monday s class out of a million friends i don t know why he chose me to be his best man but i wasn t about to disappoint him i hadn t been to a wedding since he and i were tapped at age four to carry a bridal train and spewed monstrous spittle when we realized that this was not a real train but some horrific prank name for part of a wedding dress i no longer had the excuse of being four years old but i still had the wedding know how of a four year old but with less public speaking confidence i challenged success to a duel by telling everyone that my speech was going to rock bro bro bro i got this then i snuck off to the art of manliness 124 to figure out what i was supposed to do and whether there were any more cruelly named things waiting to surprise me this time making a toast which kind of toast turns out i should have read up on what it means to catch the garter the art of manliness gave me the essential tips i needed thank the parents tell a story about the groom which shows that he s a great guy but desperately needs a great lady to fill in for a particular character trait make an appropriate joke show how the bride completes him and end with a quote and a toast not too hard if you follow the first tip prepare it in advance right well because i had to keep reading books running and learning chinese while hanging out with every family member and preparing the skritter iphone app press campaign then at the last minute needing to submit a bug fix update to the app store i found myself writing and memorizing the speech 125 at two in the morning the day of the wedding while telling my brother that i was fixing some bugs the wedding was beautiful everyone cried and a little boy brought me the rings ribboned onto a small turbocharger 126 i guess this is my brother s way of degirlifying things in revenge for the traumatic trainlessness of yore apart from the ceremony i was rehearsing my speech all day peeking at it on my phone when no one was looking did you know that after the wedding ceremony there s a whole separate part where you wait for a while go somewhere else and then resume the wedding but with even more people yeah on top of the rehearsal the rehearsal dinner the bachelor and bachelorette parties and the honeymoon complicated i don t see any point to having a separate wedding reception except for making the best man simmer in a stew of his own nerves for a couple hours then you don t even give the speech but instead everyone eats and looks at you sitting at a special table for an hour and then you get everyone s attention and give the speech this is a pretty good design but it could be scarier if i were in charge i d make the best man have to give the speech at a random time so that terror can strike at any moment he d have to drink to survive the tension this must be the point to encourage more inappropriate drunken rambling anyway after everyone ate for ninety hours i got up and started orating funny part 1 laughter funny part 2 more laughter sentimental part 1 sighing funny part 3 they laughed at that sentimental part 2 everyone loves everyone optimistic part murmur blanket forgot the quote and skipped to the toast and done hugged the glorious bro killed it received compliments the rest of the night and didn t see my phone again for hours as the text of my speech was passed around the acoustically underprivileged family flocks next i attended my skritter cofounder and best friend george s wedding george is a magnet with a million friends too but i stuck to him in college and didn t detach until becca rescued him so i got to be his best man despite the risk that i might tell the crazy sleepwalker girl story 127 or the crazy arms dealer girl story i was still on the road for the week in between weddings and still busy but i managed to write and memorize this speech days in advance george converted to judaism for this one and i worried about new sinister wedding traditions all of those traps were for the groom though i had it easy my speech this time involved a funny story about a credit card so i stole george s mastercard before the wedding i went out on the wedding dance floor in my fancy suit but with no shoes which doubles one s confidence try it and gave an even better speech than last time after the toast may you never need to run again i presented george s own credit card to him and announced but you re definitely going to need this this dumbfounded him and then we all laughed forever later after frenzied dancing and the younger brother cupcake duel and the part with the havoc chairs and the fire tunnel i realized two things one weddings are not just pranks perpetrated against the guys who have to be in them two i like public speaking that s crazy this is nick we re talking about remember how at eighteen he was too scared to order his own burritos in taco bell that guy if he now enjoys getting up in front of a hundred people making jokes and sharing tender emotions if he can do that then what can he not do i got a third chance to talk in front of 140 people this summer at a quantified self meetup in berkeley by now i knew that this was going to be fun talk about the cognitive testing self experiment that i did sure an ignite plus talk where your thirty slides each advance automatically after fifteen seconds perfect i went i spoke i conquered this social confidence is real ten dates with chloe go on ten romantic dates with chloe i m still a beginner at the previous missions in this chapter but i m pro at boyfriending the ten dates with chloe mission wasn t meant as a challenge but as a failsafe to preserve a minimum level of attention to her in case i became too busy with the other missions i spend much more time with her than that so it wouldn t make a difference right turns out that if you demand to spend a romantic evening with a girl on a night where you re clearly too busy to do any such thing and you call it a date and you show the same affection you normally do she opens triple the amount of romance receptors she charges up with love until she glows then she dissipates it over the next several days with yearnful ring finger waggling i could ask her whether we re closer now than ever before in our five years together but i know what she would say 128 gee i don t know nick why am i not married yet then she would invent yet another emoticon for glaring at me and try to do the face that corresponds with that emoticon recent creations include b and the past mock anger and into mock bereavement anyway we are closer together that is not married 129 we ended up with thirteen dates one a week score another one for beeminder you ask isn t it unromantic to rely on a web application to tell you when you need to be romantic i ll tell you what s unromantic forgetting to do things like digging caves in strawberries to put blueberries in them and surprise your girl at her bus stop with a blind no biting taste test 130 to determine what double morsel you re holding in front of her mouth beeminder may be a robotic bee that you sic on yourself but it will watch out for your girl s heart better than she will 131 talking to a hundred people have significant conversations with a hundred different people this goal didn t end up giving me extra motivation to socialize i had meaningful conversations with 173 people overshooting my goal of one hundred i had been afraid of hermitting out but between weddings quantified self meetups human hacker house events the ancestral health symposium 132 hiring interviews for skritter hiking trips and friends visiting to throw knives i have been more social than ever it was fun to track the new people i talked to though quantified mind hack on quantified mind and present to a hundred people about it this was not a well specified goal hack on quantified mind it s concrete but it s not specific how much time should i spend hacking how many features do i need to build and it s not immediate either there is no when other than sometime during the three months i wish i d written this bad goal on purpose as an example of what not to do i did get some hacking in with yoni when he had time to work on it and we built a data minding feature where users can see powerful graphs of how their cognitive performance varies with different interventions and i did give my quantified mind talk 133 to help promote it but should i have hacked more did i meet my goal even now it s hard to tell don t make vague weasel friendly goals i did much better last year with this goal work on quantified mind for three hours a week human hacker house do my part of writing content organizing events and helping housemates this goal also backfired i didn t know in advance how many blog posts the six of us were going to write for the human hacker house or how many events we would hold or how much we would help each other with our projects so i figured i ll do my part as much as the others do then my goal will scale up to however much effort is appropriate and i know keenly when i m not contributing equally so i won t just forget the other human hacker housemates must have thought similar things because no one wrote any blog posts janet set up the blog 134 chloe designed it alex and i wrote the manifesto we all brainstormed fascinating experiments to do and posts to write and then we did a bunch of experiments and didn t write them up habit failure i successfully did my share one manifesto plus zero blog posts i am shamed before i write any further i will create the first blog post introducing this calories and weight change experiment which yoni designed there 135 the organizing of events went better we held several and i helped feed host and teach knife throwing did having this explicit goal motivate me to do this i don t think so same thing with the helping of housemates on their own projects i would have done that anyway i did feel better about spending the time though having set it aside for these two purposes normally without having planned to spend time helping out i d be looking at the time and wishing to get back to my real mission i do recommend this sort of remember to be human goal for anyone like me who might otherwise forget i think most won t need it though iphone app manage launch publicity campaign and finish fixing all bugs due to the funny app store review jokes the review team pulled on us that i mentioned before our iphone app launch was a month late and aimed right in the middle of george s wedding hah good one apple between moments of bachelor parties best man duties and the projects for this book i was feral trying to maul last minute bugs and coordinate my flock of bloggers human hacker housemate eri she who knows how to court press and raise funds and marjolein hoekstra skritterer and social media maven had given me some tips on pitching bloggers about covering app launches and they d worked almost too well 25 of 27 chinese language learning bloggers i talked to agreed to cover the app launch along with many of the general tech and app bloggers this was great for publicity not so great for my sleep this was the one time during the project when i wasn t getting enough rest scott and i went back and forth about whether to prank george by releasing the app the morning of wedding and telling him during the best man speech i thought it d be hilarious but scott thought that we might need to be on hand in case something went wrong turned out we had to delay three more days anyway because apple has a funny way of counting five business days this was good because scott the reasonable one isn t called that for nothing what could go wrong i had asked how much feedback could we possibly have to respond to in one day he said that since we didn t know and since it was important we should be prepared for anything this was wise i woke up at three in the morning and pushed the launch app button it hit the app store by four and i updated the website published the skritter blog post 136 sent 15 000 emails to people interested in knowing when the app would launch posted on facebook twitter and google and thanked all of our testers emails started to arrive this guy loves the app that guy loves the app this girl sees a black screen right away where the intro should be what one of the last minute safeguards we put in to prevent a rare crash had backfired for people upgrading the app to that latest version everything worked fine so neither we nor our testers noticed 137 but for people installing it from scratch the intro didn t work nothing black screen it didn t crash and there was a complicated workaround involving skipping the intro signing up and force quitting the app but this was bad this is the third thing you do in the app and there s no apparent way past it if you did manage to skip it we then asked you for 9 99 a month on the next screen how classy we might as well have put a button there asking for a one star review disaster but what was this where were are all these five star reviews coming from everyone who learns chinese is some sort of detective saint combo apparently somehow tons of people were not only figuring out how to get past the bug and its sub bugs but also were hitting the app store right away and saying how the app was perfect and sexy and that they wanted to kiss us but it would be weird we managed an average rating of 4 4 out of 5 stars 138 for that version despite the bug the chinese language learning blog community went wild with skritter reviews and the sound of apple haters grudgingly shelling out for ipod touches just to run the app i wrote 154 emails blog comments facebook responses and tweets that day along with going to the gym at 6 30am for my first crossfit class and submitting a bug fix update 139 to the app store this is the kind of exciting day that i craved this is what i wanted yes over the rest of the summer we put together the japanese version and are launching that a week after the end of this book project this launch will be smoother startup stay on top of skritter work as cofounder and cto running a startup takes time fixing bugs takes motivation this goal was not specific but i had enough accountability to customers and cofounders that it was clear what needed to be done and so i got it done you can find out more about skritter at http www skritter com bench press go from 1 rep max of 150 lbs to 210 lbs i weigh 140 lbs before starting this project i had wanted to pick some strength training goal other than deadlifts i was sick of deadlifts 140 while participating in one of alex s muscle sensor experiments i was outbenched by a 71 year old i decided i needed to train to bench more so as not to dishonor my ancestors 141 how much more i didn t know but i figured that since i hadn t done any pressing exercises in six months i probably had lost some strength that would be easy to get back at first and so if i increased my bench press by sixty pounds this would be appropriately ambitious with my goal set i tested my max and found to mixed dismay that it was higher than it had ever been 150 lbs not the 135 lbs from last fall uh oh this would mean i would have to hit 210 lbs or 1 5 times my bodyweight i followed janet s chaotic exercise regimen ate many pounds of protein got extra sleep eradicated my left right imbalances with the least pleasant workouts yet and improved my technique janet had me doing sets with very low reps so as to allow for more training often five sets of two reps with five minutes rest in between in total i only did 112 non warmup reps of bench press after three months i had gained 1 5 lbs of fat and 4 lbs of muscle i approached the bench for my final test bristling with muscle sensors 142 i got to 190 lbs and couldn t lift anything heavier i failed to increase my bench press by sixty pounds instead only gaining forty pounds rats while i failed at my goal i still grew stronger because my goal was an output goal measured by results rather than an input goal measured by time or effort i knew i wouldn t be able to control whether i succeeded only whether i put in the time i chose sixty pounds because it excited me even though i knew that it might be too much so i m not too disappointed by my failure i ll continue to train bench press after this and i ll get to 210 soon marathon build endurance from 5 miles to 26 2 while increasing speed by 10 i chose this goal because i wanted to be able to run fast for a long time and running a marathon in four hours sounded like an exciting way to make sure i could do that i had nearly killed myself on a forced five mile run to get back home for a meeting the month before starting this project and that was at a ten minute mile pace before starting the project i ran a pretest 5k to see more accurately where i was at the good i finished it the bad everything hurt and i limped home the terrible it took me 28 15 or 9 06 per mile basically the same as the 9 09 pace i d need for the marathon i d have to maintain my 5k pace 8 5 times as long most people will train for a marathon using long slow runs averaging forty miles per week and training for five to six months 143 a common guideline is to increase mileage by no more than 10 a week to get the body used to running longer and longer i did not have time for this and my starting endurance sucked so janet advised that i try doing high intensity interval training plus crossfit metabolic conditioning workouts with daily stretching weekly runs of 5 10k and a half marathon after two months these exercises were very hard and unpleasant but i did them all in total i only ran for sixty nine miles but running itself was only a small part of the training i did when it came time for the half marathon which i ran in san francisco with 24 000 other runners i had no idea what to expect the longest run i had done so far was 6 2 miles at a ten minute mile pace janet told me to run this in under two hours running a marathon in four hours is roughly equivalent to running a half marathon in 1 56 08 144 at least cardiovascularly assuming one doesn t fall apart at the greater distance i woke up at 5 30 a m and froze my way across the city to the second half marathon start while waiting for the 8 30 a m go time i chatted with the other runners who all looked at me with pity when i told them about my training as if i were an excited child about to step into the ring with mike tyson then the race started and i blasted past a thousand of them in my convertible shorts and dorky giant headphones i hadn t noticed for the past two months because of the grueling interval training but it turns out that running is fun i started off conservatively slow but as i kept feeling great i sped up throughout the race there were bystanders holding funny signs 145 bands playing people giving high fives and beautiful scenery to motivate the runners i played a game where i would target someone ahead of me and make a micro goal to pass him or her take that delay i was so excited that i ran the last 2 2 miles at a pace almost as fast as my one mile time trials motivation success i finished the race in 1 56 01 destroying my target of two hours and even beating that four hour marathon equivalent time by seven seconds i found chloe and janet sat down and snarfed some post race snacks and then got up to walk to a dim sum place half a block away i got there an hour later after chloe carried me to the first aid tent where i got iced down and gelled up and where i stupidly refused crutches my tent to dim sum segment was run at a blistering three hour mile pace which is roughly in the 0th percentile for males aged 20 29 my knees were burnt enchiladas my right foot was a smoldering chorizo mash and my left foot was an adorable angora rabbit with all its bones replaced by thorns i had barely felt any of this during the race where i had apparently been landing too hard on my unprepared feet despite my trained toe striking style 146 i could hardly walk for four days and it was another week before i could make the half mile to the grocery store to buy food so i was living on meat sticks dark chocolate and tinned oysters for six days it was twelve days before my left foot stopped hurting when standing i continued to do non weight bearing exercises in the hopes that i would recover and be able to run the marathon and i took the electric longboard down to see an active release therapist who tortured my left calf and told me that i could try run walking the marathon if i loved death with a week to go i tried a slow one hour run and had to stop after fifty minutes from the pain janet had been right three months was too short i decided that running the marathon was too hazardous that i d get stress fractures in my wimpy feet and that run walking a slow marathon would be anticlimactic i didn t do the marathon failing my goal this was a big disappointment i had been so psyched to see that my half marathon time indicated that my endurance was almost there after two months i had done every exercise and stretched every stretch but it wasn t enough my marathon goal ended in failure but i realized that i d fulfilled one of my reasons for training to be able to run fast for a long time without tiring i can t say that i ve run a four hour marathon but i can go running whenever i want and enjoy it which is something i ve always wanted to be able to do and for which i have never been fit enough until now this marathon experience highlights for me the key question of when it s okay to give up on a goal and not do something that i said i would do this should almost never happen because every time it does it weakens my expectancy in myself to be able to do hard things in the future if i can t trust myself not to make excuses for why it s okay to give up then my motivation is going to take a big hit in this case i knew in advance that i would have to skip the marathon if i got injured during training but this injury seemed borderline was it medically necessary to quit or was it overblown fear telling me not do it i couldn t tell i debated for days made a cost benefit analysis with all sorts of values for how likely i was to get how injured for how long versus how likely i would be to finish and how much that would be worth to me i consulted friends and experts everything seemed to be a toss up between run walking it and not doing it at all with a rough expected value of 1400 147 for trying to run it quickly as i had wanted in the end i think i made the right call if you find yourself where i was wondering whether it s okay to abandon a goal then think thoroughly the pain of having to finish a bad goal is often a fair price for the lesson on picking your goals it s better to strengthen the habit of finishing goals good and bad than to cultivate the habit of quitting when it gets hard but don t break yourself 5k run an official 5k in 23 15 from a pre test of 28 15 if i couldn t attempt the marathon then i would crush the 5k 148 i knew i was faster from the training but how much the last 5k trial had been at 25 52 ten weeks before had i improved another 2 37 since then could i maintain the 7 29 pace with chloe janet three other friends and thousands of runners in white shirts i lined up for the color me rad 5k this race had a twist while you ran they threw colored powder at you like in a holi celebration so that by the end you looked like a mutant rainbow puked on you 149 i ran as hard as i could trying to break 23 15 when i finished my phone told me 22 05 what there s no way i could have been that fast from what the gps told me i suspect the course was only 4 62k my best estimate of my extrapolated time is 23 32 which is 17 seconds short of my goal 94 of the way worthwhile but disappointing i would have felt a bit better about the time if i hadn t talked to my brother about it he said that the last time he ran a 5k just for kicks he hadn t been training that he ran it in just over 18 minutes by following this ex military guy in front of him he then lay gasping death on a picnic table for twenty minutes while the guy laughed and ran the 5k again to show off it s a good thing i didn t hear that story before all the training or i wouldn t have placed as much value in my goal of 23 15 now i have another goal if i can drop my 5k time by another five minutes i can compete with the past glory of my twin it will take more than three months but i will keep running happiness hit average experiential happiness of 7 3 over the three months here is my happiness tracking scale 1 suicidally depressed 2 majorly depressed or in tons of pain 3 frustrated or annoyed or sad or hurting or generally unhappy 4 a little down 5 okay i guess 6 happy 7 happy to the point of smiling or rocking out 8 excitedly happy awesome 9 everything is just perfect 10 contender for best moment of my life i like to think of it as a logarithmic scale or rather two logarithmic scales where each point above five doubles my happiness and each point below five doubles my unhappiness i have recorded my experiential happiness using this scale for the past two years randomly each day an average of three times this has taught me much about what makes me happy and unhappy but apart from filtering my music collection i had never tried to optimize my happiness i had never structured my day to have more happiness and less unhappiness i had always just worked even when i did things like adventuring in costa rica i still maintained my typical mean happiness of 6 00 150 the highest average happiness was the previous 6 41 summer in silicon valley where for the first time i found many people who were my people then i came back to pittsburgh and worked harder than ever averaging 6 26 with this book i aimed to crush that i would leave no room in any days for not pursuing value in all of the exciting meaningful and enjoyable missions i had lined up i would have variety and vigor and would fear no negativity i optimistically aimed to double my happiness adding a whole point to 7 3 it did not work the first two months were good 6 39 and 6 41 not double happiness great but good as happy as i had ever been but then i finished my book draft early and had no glorious writing left to do and worse i was underchallenged with all that extra time in the day i averaged only 5 90 for the last month my overall average was 6 26 the same as when i did nothing but work on the skritter iphone app through this project i became better i accomplished things which fueled my confidence i learned skills i ll use the rest of my life i got in shape and i improved my relationships all of my motivation hacking was successful even if four of the uncontrollable results weren t quite what i wanted but this fifth failure the failure to be happier despite great effort to do so this mark is black the psychological literature on well being indicates that it s very hard to change one s happiness apart from fixing problems like illness and poverty most attempts fail in acclimation and returns to baseline you quickly get used to new states and they stop making you happier i thought that i could do it using my experiential sampling method and clever analysis to determine what could make me happiest i had the freedom and motivation to structure my day however i liked why didn t it work i m not sure i am sorry i wish i had in this book an answer for the question of how to live it turns out i only have half an answer how to do anything you want the other half figuring out what to want that i don t know 151 i m young and naive so i ll keep trying if you have ideas for ways of living that can improve experiential happiness let me know i ll test them out i opened this book with a quote from walter pater s the renaissance 152 to burn always with this hard gem like flame to maintain this ecstasy is success in life he is speaking of chasing passions and being present in every moment 153 one cannot design a perfect life and then stop for to treat any two moments alike is to live less i don t know what to do but i aim to do as much of it as possible and much is possible i ll keep hacking motivation and i ll keep burning and i ll live a giant s life 154 ']"
